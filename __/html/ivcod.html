<h1 id="center-of-doubt">Center of Doubt</h1>

<div class="by">by Ivar Veerm&auml;e</div>

<p><em>Center of Doubt</em> is a long-term artistic research
project. The aim of the project is to explore and visualize the
disappearance and reappearance of network technology, its
infrastructure and representation. <em>Center of Doubt</em> is a
collection of visual traces depicting the data industry of our
times.</p>

<p>The appearance of the commercial 'cloud computing', or more
precisely the data centers and their supporting infrastructure, is
depicted as a turning point of a new era of centralized Internet:
big corporations are in a competition to gain a fundamental status
for their software and hardware, acting as a basic informational
layer.</p>

<h2 id="the-clouds">The Clouds</h2>

<p>I started my research by making video-based investigations about
data centers, being interested in the material, local and
environmental properties of the sites. I surveilled these technical
buildings in Berlin, Tallinn and Frankfurt. The architecture of
data centers has hidden or stealthy qualities, facilities are
blended into cityspace. Being in the background is one of the main
qualities of material infrastructure in general. This leads to a
situation where what is actually visible is rendered invisible by
being unobtrusive. In addition, there is an interesting gap between
materiality and immateriality, which is intentionally ignored in
representational rhetorics of IT companies. It is true that
information is immaterial, but it is also true that material
structures are needed to operate it.</p>

<p>Bruno Latour has a suggestion in his Actor-Network-Theory for
thinking about things -- make their role more important:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Non-humans have to be actors and not simply the hapless bearers
of symbolic projection.<sup><a href="#1b0ada41">1</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<!-- % TEXINJECT: \scalefont{1.02} -->

<p>An actor, according to Latour, is meant as something/someone
who/which influences the behaviour of other actors. Symbolic
representation is offered often in finished and therefore closed
form, which forestalls further discussion. In addition, when things
are seen only as fulfilling the role assigned to them by their
human creators, their role as mediator disappears.</p>

<p>The big things &ndash; data centers &ndash; in the cities remain
hard to recognize, but more importantly, server farms are mostly
hidden in remote places with suitable properties &ndash; like
climate, taxes, but also security.</p>

<h2 id="crystal-computing-google-inc.-st.-ghislain">Crystal
Computing (Google Inc., St. Ghislain)</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>Dear Sir,</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>We unfortunately do not organise or allow visits to our
datacenters for data security reason.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>This is the main reason why we setup a website where I am sure,
you will find a lot of useful information on
<a href="http://www.google.com/about/datacenters." class="linkify">http://www.google.com/about/datacenters.</a></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Thanks st-ghislain@google.com, 05.02.13</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I continued my research with Google's data center in
Saint-Ghislain, Belgium. It is the largest Google data center in
Europe and the second largest in the world. According to the
official information from Google Inc., it housed 296,960 servers in
2013. After my request to visit the data center officially was
rejected, I took a secret research trip to Belgium. The facility,
located on the outskirts of of the small city St. Ghislain, is
heavily protected &ndash; in addition to very strong non-human
security &ndash; fences, CCTV cameras, motion detectors &ndash;
there are also physical security guards circling the building every
30 minutes. The data center has water cooling, which produces
colossal clouds of steam. This is reminiscent of old images of
factories, but in fact it is a factory of 21st century.</p>

<p>The data center in Belgium has no visual traces of Google: the
existing signs identify the place as Crystal Computing. Ironically,
the name represents the secret policies of the corporation and also
the establishment of subsidiaries as a method for tax avoidance.
Interesting movements can be found in official founding documents
of the Crystal Computing data center &ndash; representatives and
capital have changed quite regularly over the course of few
years.</p>

<h2 id="the-formation-of-clouds">The Formation of Clouds</h2>

<p>As the Internet is currently becoming more and more a
centralized corporate space, it is important to explore the
immaterial thinking that has not changed so much during the course
of 25 years. Previously dominant in the announcements of
cyber-idealists, it is now used as a basic language in corporate
advertising. Cyber-libertarians praised the ideology of
immateriality, non-governmentality and libertarianism. '<em>A
Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace</em>', written by
John Barry Barlow in Davos during the World Economic Forum (1996),
is a perfect example of this kind of thinking:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Governments of the Industrial World, you weary giants of flesh
and steel, I come from Cyberspace, the new home of Mind. On behalf
of the future, I ask you of the past to leave us alone. You are not
welcome among us. You have no sovereignty where we
gather.<sup><a href="#e76564bc">2</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>and:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Your legal concepts of property, expression, identity, movement,
and context do not apply to us. They are based on matter. There is
no matter here.<sup><a href="#e79861d3">3</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In this kind of conceptualization of cyberspace, which was
supposed to be a home for pure mind in its immateriality, the
mediatory role of technology is &ndash; probably consciously
&ndash; forgotten. WIRED, the advocate and lobby agency of the
Internet, concentrated mostly on <em>liberation</em>, which could
be understood in a <em>libertarian</em>sense. In the beginning, the
Internet had <em>libertarian 'wild-west'</em> characteristics, but
soon it was capitalized. The main idea of cyberspace was
communicated as a technology that connects humans, and therefore is
radically different from exploitative industrial technology. Now it
is clear that this kind of utopic cyberspace does not exist &ndash;
there is no unified Internet, but mostly various corporate surfaces
or spaces. It could be seen as a new wave of industrialism, or
rather informationalism, which is supported by huge data-industrial
buildings.</p>

<p>I am exploring this notion in <em>The Formation of Clouds</em>
by concentrating on the formation of data centers, owned by world's
leading digital companies &ndash; Microsoft, Apple, Facebook,
Google and Amazon. The activities of these global network companies
lead to highly centralized Internet access. The acknowledgement of
the development of centralization on the infrastructural level is
even more important, as user generated data is being stored and
processed in data centers that are owned by private
corporations.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Because the actual technological shape of the system is
uncertain, whoever controls its first stages could decisively
influence its future evolution.<sup><a href="#fc21b236">4</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The most important aspect of <em>The Formation of Clouds</em> is
that it reveals the competition between companies to gain the best
possible position in running the basic underlying informational
infrastructure of everyday life.</p>

<h2 id="corporate-power-and-diy-servitude">Corporate Power and DIY
Servitude</h2>

<p>To understand the backgrounds of information technology, it is
important to concentrate on the abstract notion of corporate power
and its influences. According to Deleuze and Guattari, it is
relevant to think about the concept of knowledge and its role:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Knowledge, information, and specialized education are just as
much parts of capital. 'Knowledge capital' as is the most
elementary labor or the worker.<sup><a href="#e26ef2b6">5</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Anti-Oedipus: Capitalism and Schizophrenia was first published
in 1972, when major restructualization was just getting underway,
and knowledge-based schemes began to evolve. Important changes that
supported this system took place in the mid-70s and early 80s, as
Manuel Castells writes:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In turn (1980s), the availability of new telecommunication
networks and information systems prepared the ground for the global
integration of financial markets and the segmented articulation of
production and trade throughout the world. &hellip; Thus, to some
extent, the availability of new technologies constituted as a
system in the 1970s was a fundamental basis for the process of
socioeconomic restructuring in the 1980s.<sup><a href="#fee2dbd6">6</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is important to notice that the changes to immaterial
knowledge and information were directly dependent on the material
developments of information technology. And conversely, material
infrastructure was highly dependent on information. This system was
the foundation for two principal fields:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The new economy emerged in a given time, the 1990s, a given
space, the United States, and around/from specific industries,
mainly information technology and finance.<sup><a href="#452cc648">7</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is a strong interrelation between the global financial
system and information technology: could the former was able to
develop through the latter, and the latter was dependent on the
former. Information technology became a source of development and
economic growth. These changes were realized in consumer culture,
which was mainly oriented to youth. Origins of this idea &ndash;
the adolescent as a perfect consumer &ndash; lay in US
counterculture, as Fred Turner writes:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Counterculture opened the doors of the youth movement to the
complex delights of consumer culture.<sup><a href="#fad1f92f">8</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The discovery or rather production of consumerism by various
business enterprises created gigantic profits for them. According
to Fred Turner, Steward Brand and the Whole Earth Network had an
important role in these developments. In the late 60s the Whole
Earth Network had published Whole Earth Catalogues. These were
booklets containing information about various tools and thoughts,
advertising a wide range of products &ndash; geodesic domes, tents,
books about cybernetics and systems theory, but also
microcomputers. The catalogue was a mixture of tool- and idea-set
for back-to-the-land hippies with new information theory. By the
end of the 1980s the Whole Earth Network had been transformed into
Global Business Network. It was a business consulting firm using
ideas that were a mixture of hippie ideology and entrepreneurship.
GBN made connections between entrepreneurs, corporations, and
government agencies. It supported two principal ideas, which had a
huge influence later:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>corporation as site of revolutionary social change and
interpersonal and information networks as tools and emblems of that
change.<sup><a href="#b3331956">9</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Accompanied by:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>(Whole Earth) -- Over time, the network's members and forums
helped redefine microcomputer as 'personal' machine, computer
communication networks as 'virtual communities', and cyberspace
itself as the digital equivalent of the western landscape into
which so many communards set forth in the late 1960s, the
'electronic frontier'.<sup><a href="#5fea765c">10</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>These two notions &ndash; the corporation as a site for social
change and the 'personalization' of technology &ndash; influenced a
clear move from politics to consumerism, from citizen to consumer,
and from state to corporation. The main ideology of this movement
is that one must liberate oneself. It is tricky, because one is
never finished, therefore she/he must constantly develop themselves
to achieve 'liberation'. As Deleuze clearly states
in<em>'Postscript on Societies of Control'</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In the disciplinary societies one was always starting again
(from the school to the barracks, from the barracks to the
factory), while in the societies of control one is never finished
with anything &ndash; the corporation, the educational system, the
armed services being metastable states coexisting in one and the
same modulation.<sup><a href="#8824f610">11</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>One is never finished and must always modulate him/herself
through the expression of her/his individuality. Bluntly said,
nowadays consuming the products is transformed to being a product.
Zygmunt Bauman and David Lyon have found a clever term for this
&ndash; DIY servitude:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>'Making oneself a sellable commodity' is a DIY job, individual
duty. &hellip; The goods they (who) present as 'tools' for
individual use in decision-making are in fact decisions made in
advance. They were ready-made well before the individual was
confronted with the duty (presented as an opportunity) to
decide.<sup><a href="#b33c8c27">12</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The 'personal technology' one uses is never finished, it needs
constant development. It is made for persons who are supposed to be
making themselves using these products &ndash; yet forgetting their
intermediary role. The hard- and software products are surfaces
that only function when user feeds them with information. As Bauman
and Lyon clarify:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>All those technical gadgets are, we are told, 'user friendly'
&ndash; though that favourite phrase of commercial copy means,
under closer scrutiny, a product that is incomplete without the
user's labour &hellip; not a voluntary, but a DIY
servitude...<sup><a href="#13e63042">13</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The system is based on clever mimicry &ndash; free labor for
corporations is masked as personal development &ndash; DIY, finding
one's own liberation. One of the reasons why it works so well is
found in the articulation: the corporate space, or rather the
surface &ndash; the workfield &ndash; is named as a social network.
On the one hand, naming commercial activities communal transformed
the image of some corporations from greedy and evil to fun and
likable. On the other, an ideal, utopian place, which was not
accomplished by US counterculture, was transferred to Internet. In
its beginning the Internet had a libertarian cyber-frontier
character, but it changed under corporate domination. This is
supported by corporate images &ndash; social, playful, pure, or
innovative.</p>

<h2 id="the-given">The Given</h2>

<p>As a conclusion it is important to think about distractions,
which could eventually stop further thinking. In big data based
operations the person does not exist. The personal and private
sphere is a distraction, which could divert attention to the actual
person and the protection and improvement of this private sphere.
Correlative mechanisms and algorithms deal with data in the form of
data points, fixations, categories, and their relations. These are
the given properties, which will be used to define various targets,
or more exactly target groups. Data &ndash; a record of an actual
event (textual, biological, chemical, geological) &ndash; could be
justified through its existence. Bauman and Lyon write about the
potential problem:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Data double tends to be trusted more than the person, who
prefers to tell their own tale.<sup><a href="#ac217c37">14</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Data double is an abstraction that exists only in an
anthropocentric view. But as a useful abstraction it has valuable
qualities. Talking, explaining, or associating is uncertain,
therefore it must justify its existence. This could be compared
with the criminal process, where evidence is something that exists
as a trace, whether biological, geological, chemical, digital.
Through its existence it is justified, but still interpreted
associatively by humans, who take uncertain aspects &ndash; motive,
moods, etc. &ndash; into account. But a shift to the quantitative
is happening in many domains, as Mayer-Sch&ouml;nberger and Cukier
write:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>'Big-data consciousness' -- presumption that there is
quantitative component to all that we do, and that data is
indispensable for society to learn from.<sup><a href="#d0a7a5eb">15</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Since quantities are fixed categories, mostly based on events
that have already happened, it is easy to justify them through
their existence. Big data could appear to its users as given
information, but more precisely it is the other way around &ndash;
the user is the one who gives valuable information to companies and
states. And since fixing is a stabilization, then it could
influence the potentially changing user. With this situation the
main problem is: how can one make bigger changes, when the
predictions in form of suggestions are provided mostly by
commercial companies, who are relying more on optimization and
stability? Big data could eventually reach its etymological status
&ndash; a (something that is) given (origin from Latin).</p>

<p>I explore the notion of quantification and big data in my
videowork Patent Application Data. It is an attempt to go beyond
the typical visual representation of data centers &ndash; blinking
lights, cables, large sterile halls full of server racks. The
patent drawings of data centers and their various processes provide
a purified image that refers to the most important operations.
Flowcharts, electrical schemes and machine drawings draw attention
to the primary goals of data processing &ndash; to order and
optimize the messy physical world.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Move away from the age-old search for causality &hellip; instead
we can discover patterns and correlations &hellip; The correlations
may not tell us precisely why something is happening, but they
alert us that it is happening. Big data is about what, not
why.<sup><a href="#466bb464">16</a></sup></p>
