Behind the Smart World ArtLab -- artistic strategies for dealing
with resurfacing data</h1>

<blockquote>
<p>Breaches of Western information security thanks to a rise in
electronic waste circulation have been particularly pronounced in
Ghana, where a certain cadre of citizens has taken to searching out
information on Westerners&rsquo; old hard drives for extortive 
<!-- %> purposes.[@warner:2011:cybercrime]  -->
 purposes.<sup><a href="#c9a8a00e">1</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Since 2010 we as KairUs artist duo have focused on researching
topics such as spam, scam and Internet fraud. In August 2014 our
research had evolved to the stage that we needed to take a field
trip to West Africa, where a considerable number of so called
advance fee fraud originates. Rather than hunting down scammers in
Internet caf&eacute;s, we were interested to see which
technological affordances or limitations the scammers were faced
with in this part of the world. In our initial research we came
across reports about an electronic waste dump called Agbogbloshie.
In the middle of Ghana&rsquo;s capital Accra, in this toxic
wasteland by a lagoon, is where our electronics from developed
countries are illegally dumped. Jennifer Garbys examines in her
book <em>Digital Rubbish</em><sup><a href="#45196e0c">2</a></sup>
in detail how electronic waste ends up at e-waste dumps such as
Agbogbloshie; first they linger in storage, from there high-grade
machines might be resold, the dysfunctional machines are then
shipped in containers to harbors in developing countries such as
the one in Tema, where most of the e-waste enters Ghana. In Tema
the containers are sold and transported to Agbogbloshie. The next
step is the salvaging of components, copper, gold, iron, plastic,
and anything else of value.</p>

<p>Electronics are made of minerals and chemicals, natural
resources that are gleaned by organic laboring bodies, no matter
whether this takes place at an e-waste dump or in a mine. One of
the most memorable sounds from Agbogbloshie was the clacking sound
of metal scrap hitting the aluminum structures of a computer, when
the workers were disassembling the computers into mother boards,
processors and hard drives and further for extraction of valuable
metals and raw earth minerals. Components and materials salvaged at
Agbogbloshie enter new cycles of production, reentering the
consumption cycle, whereas the residues remain. Moore&rsquo;s Law,
a near golden law within the world of computing, predicted the
computer revolution in which the rate of innovation within
electronics has decreased to as little as 18 months.<sup><a href="#95d46dba">3</a></sup> Creating something new will thus be
followed by an another gadget turning old. These old electronics,
dead media, or zombie media, as Jussi Parikka, names them leave
fossilized traces of designed obsolescence and
gadget-culture.<sup><a href="#92d2d5c7">4</a></sup> At Agbogbloshie
these materials are difficult to recycle; the toxic, unstable
materials mix with the black ashes of burned cables and pieces of
electronic fossils. They pile in indefinitely growing layers of
obsolete technologies, if not directly washed through the lagoon
into the sea, as we witnessed during a day of heavy rain. This is
how: <em>&ldquo;dead media creeps back as dangerous toxins into the
soil or then as zombie media recycled into new
assemblies&rdquo;</em><sup><a href="#73b4d354">5</a></sup>.
Agbogbloshie, our electronic dystopia earned its nickname - Sodom
and Gomorrah.</p>
<!-- % TEXINJECT: \scalefont{.99} -->

<p>Among other components, <em>&ldquo;zombie&rdquo;</em> hard
drives also enter a new chain of value available at Agbogbloshie in
stock for a negotiated price. Likewise the data saved on these
storage media resurface, even if they were dumped in the trash,
both physically and metaphorically, in the bin on our computer
desktop with an expectation of permanent deletion. What took us to
Agbogbloshie in the first place were reports we read on how
journalism students had discovered data breaches of companies and
governments when recovering data from hard drives bought at the
e-waste dump.<sup><a href="#99abeda8">6</a></sup> Additionally we
found articles describing how scammers abused data originating from
hard drives collected at e-waste dumps in West Africa.<sup><a href="#e7a30f75">7</a></sup> Therefore, when visiting Agbogbloshie we
decided to buy twenty-two hard drives, curious to see whether
dumped data would persist, and could it easily be recovered and
would it be of potential value? Could the data be artistically
reused and/or rather easily abused?</p>
<!-- % RESETFONT: -->

<p>When we returned to Linz our plan was to follow media theorist
Jussi Parikka's suggestion:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In the age of consumer electronics, the artist can also be
thought of as an archaeological circuit bender and hacker, which
links media archeology with the political agenda of contemporary
media production.<sup><a href="#b2ab7822">8</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Our plan was therefore to recover the data from the hard drives
and offer the data and the hard drives as source material for
artistic production. During two DIY-data recovery sessions we
accessed data from three hard drives, just by plugging them in to a
computer. This means that the data on the hard drives was not even
deleted. Two hard drives were recovered by trying out open source
tools such as PhotoRec, TestDisc and Partition Magic. In these
cases the data was deleted by the owner, by trashing it into the
&ldquo;bin&rdquo; or using the delete command. We learned that
deleting data is a rather symbolic gesture, whereas the data is not
actually deleted until it is overwritten. According to data
specialists, even overwritten data can be recovered with special
tools<sup><a href="#26b7c8b3">9</a></sup> and the only hundred
percent secure way to delete data is to physically destroy the
plate where the data is stored. This was demonstrated in one of the
&ldquo;stranger episodes in the history of digital-age
journalism&rdquo;, when the Guardian had to destroy all their hard
drive copies of NSA files leaked by Edward Snowden.<sup><a href="#d5c2f21d">10</a></sup> What made the episode strange was that
British authorities supervising the erasure of the data as well as
the journalist were all aware of existing copies in America and
Brazil, proving that the strength of digital data to persist is in
the easiness of duplicating it.</p>

<p>Of our twenty-two hard drives, seventeen were physically
damaged. In this case such parts as the internal read write heads
or the spindle motor can be changed and the data can still be
recovered. The complicated part is to get the spare parts, as each
brand and model use customized parts, which can still vary
depending on the manufacturing country. Therefore we asked for help
from the company ECS-solutions that recovers lost data as a
business model. Even with their help only one additional hard drive
was recovered. This was mainly because the hard drives where
relatively old, with production dates ranging from 1997-2008, and
spare parts were not easily available.</p>

<p>With 85 GB (229.446 items) of recovered data from six hard
drives we approached nine European artists with various artistic
practices, inviting them to use the data and the hard drives as a
source for creating artworks. In May 2015 we met for an extended
weekend to discuss ideas and our approaches to the recovered data
during the &ldquo;Behind the Smart World&rdquo; ArtLab.
Considerations raised during the ArtLab led to discussions about
ownership of data, how to deal with abstraction of data, how to
avoid exposing private individuals without their consent, and the
labor of structuring data that mostly consisted of
&ldquo;junk&rdquo; such as porn, system files, and images
downloaded while shopping online. Browsing through the recovered
hard drives, it became rather obvious that as a consequence of
seemingly unlimited data storage, we hoard rather than collect
data. Rather fast it became a laborious task to get an overview of
what just a couple of hard drives contain, specially when recovered
data lack both filenames and structure.</p>

<p>During the weekend we also invited experts in data recovery,
data forensics, and data policies to support us in developing
strategies to deal with the data. Additionally, a visit to a
recycling center gave us to better understanding of the material
aspects of electronic waste.</p>

<p>As an outcome of the ArtLab we developed strategies for dealing
with the data, which developed into concepts and further to
artworks for an exhibition. There were two main approaches that
emerged from the ArtLab, one of them focusing on the recovered data
and the other exploring the material aspects of the physical hard
drives. We became aware early on that using data from a hard drive
as found footage needed a different approach than photographs, film
or video cassettes found in a box at a flea-market. Our data
forensics expert Dr. Michael Sonntag suggested that we should mix
data to avoid accidentally exposing a person&rsquo;s identity.
Another approach was to transform the data, mapping it to another
format, which is the case with Joakim Blattmann&rsquo;s artwork, in
which metadata and folder structures from the hard drives are
mapped to a musical score for a classical piano. Metadata can
expose surprisingly private information and folder structures are
like personal memory paths. As a soundscape certain patterns can
still be revealed, while by abstracting the source we avoid
exposing any private data.</p>

<p>Fabian K&uuml;hfuss&rsquo;s work <em>Shopimation</em> examines
how rather impersonal images downloaded in our browser cache during
online shopping can bring us closer to an unknown individual and
his or her &ldquo;aesthetic dreams&rdquo;. <em>Shopimation</em>
uses thumbnails to build up a subjective code of an aesthetic,
thereby translating the very private dream of who the owner of the
hard drive would like to be. This work echoes the economic
ecologies of our commodified Internet experiences, in which our
profiles, interests and desires are continuously tracked and used
to accelerate our consumption.</p>

<p>Em&ouml;ke Bada's <em>Virus Chart</em>, on the other hand, looks
at the trackers, the malware and viruses &ndash; the unwanted
intruders on our hard drives. As the artist explains in an
e-mail:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Before even starting to look at any of the files, I followed the
standard procedure of running a virus scan. Which was interesting
because at the end of the day, on the harddrives that have been
recovered so far, there were 881 viruses all in all.**<sup><a href="#f5260b39">11</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Earlier viruses and malware were often destructive, even causing
physical damage to the host, while today&rsquo;s digital parasites
hoard data and are most successful as long as they are not
recognized. The <em>Virus Chart</em> takes a close look on the
&ldquo;health&rdquo; of these hard drives using medical charts as a
metaphor to describe their maleficent content. Could it also be
that the &ldquo;poor health&rdquo; of the hard drives was the
reason why they ended up at Agbogbloshie in the first place?</p>

<p>In a trilogy of installations, we as the artist duo KairUs
returned to our initial research questions of what is the value of
the data on a hard drive and how could it potentially be (ab)used?
We know that dealing with data is a rather lucrative business
today, yet as we learned from our data policies expert Fieke
Jansen, the data of one person is worth only 0.7-0.01USD (a
speculative estimate made by dividing Google&rsquo;s value by its
users). In these terms data points are only valuable when connected
to others, revealing patterns and desires. Selling the content of a
hard drive to data brokers is worth less than selling its spare
parts to a company in the data recovery business. What can make a
hard drive valuable, on the other hand, is sensitive personal data
that can be abused, including access to banking or shopping
accounts, private images for blackmailing and harassment, or
identity theft. This was the case with U.S. Congressman Robert
Wexler. He was contacted and blackmailed with information from one
of his discarded hard drives that was found in a second-hand
computer market in Ghana.<sup><a href="#e7a30f75">12</a></sup> By
using DIY-data forensic methods combined with open source
intelligent strategies and tools, it was also possible for us to
confirm one of the owners of a hard drive with sensitive images.
And another hard drive shows evidence of being used for romance
scams. The potential abusing of data is therefore the focal point
of these works, illustrating a number of &ldquo;worst case
scenarios&rdquo; based on the recovered data. Even if there is
nothing to hide, your deleted data might still return to haunt
you.</p>

<p>Shifting to the works that deal with the material aspects of the
hard drives, Michael Wirthig&rsquo;s <em>Inside Data (The
Forgotten)</em> focuses on the drive platter as the actual physical
container of our data on a hard drive. This experimental film
travels through the inner parts of a hard drive in extreme
close-ups, using light field microscope images to give the viewer
an intimate perspective of the rather impersonal metal plate.
Scratches and dust are made visible, the most common physical
damage to our hard drives and most often the reason for these
devices to fail. As it was impossible to recover the data from the
majority of the hard drives brought back from Ghana, this work
investigates the most fragile parts of digital data storage.</p>

<p>From a forensic perspective, which rests on individualization,
each hard drive is unique. When zooming in enough with a magnetic
force microscope, even <em>&ldquo;individual bit representations
deposit discreet legible trails&rdquo;</em><sup><a href="#1293ed5b">13</a></sup>, forcing us to review our perspective on
the illusion of an immaterial bit just as a symbol either as a 1 or
a 0. Also Simon Krenn&rsquo;s and Mathias Urban&rsquo;s work
<em>Transposon</em> deals with the material aspects of data and
storage media. During the ArtLab the artists collected magnetic
field recordings from the hard drives, and when the sounds were
amplified the experiment revealed that each hard drive has a unique
sound. In the <em>Transposon</em> sound installation, the sounds
are further recorded to wax cylinders via a modified Edison GEM
phonograph, the earliest commercial medium to record and reproduce
sound. The recordings are in this way reversely migrated from one
&ldquo;zombie medium&rdquo; to another and further back to be mixed
and listened to again in a digital format. Each migration brings
further qualities to the sound, which is transformed along with the
migration processes. Likewise, when any data is migrated, even in
the case of digital files loss, corruption and glitches appear.
These obsolete media with about a decade of age difference are the
black boxes we as artists are called on to hack, bend and
re-purpose, in order to critically reflect on our current
relationship to electronics, their life cycles and residues. The
twenty-two hard drives brought back from Agbogbloshie functioned as
vehicle to discuss data privacy, data collection, data forensics,
e-waste, erasure of data, and dead media. Behind the shiny smart
world of advertisers, another reality is revealed, unfolding the
consequences of our datafied consumer culture, which is far from
being sustainable or fair.</p>
