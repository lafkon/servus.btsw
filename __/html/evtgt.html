THE GOOGLE TRILOGY: OR HOW TO PLAY WITH GOOGLE STREET VIEW</h1>

<div class="by">by Emilio Vavarella</div>

<p>Borrowing the term &ldquo;metamorphosis&rdquo; from Elias
Canetti&rsquo;s philosophy, my research revolves around what I
define as &ldquo;visual metamorphosis&rdquo;, through
interdisciplinary art projects. According to Canetti,
<em>metamorphosis</em> describes the essential goal of survival
achieved through countless creative endeavors, and can be
understood as that which enables humans to resist the power that
dominates them. In his notes, Canetti explains how
<em>metamorphosis</em> is the beginning of existence, what power is
afraid of, what art should always create, and what has been
expressed &ndash; since the beginning of time &ndash; in our
dreams.<sup><a href="#7aa2b8af">1</a></sup> Indeed, a recurrent
image in mythology is that of a human, who in order to escape from
danger (some form of external power), transforms him/herself into
an animal or a plant, and if that danger also changes its form to
continue chasing its prey, the human will again transform
him/herself, in a constant loop of metamorphoses. The history of
art and literature are the richest repositories of such visions,
and today the theme is so widespread (one must only think of
contemporary posthumanism and transhumanism) that its prevalence
can be compared only to its presence in the Greek and Latin
traditions.</p>

<p>The concept of <em>metamorphosis</em> has adapted to the times,
but its essence has remained the same. Stories of people
shape-shifting into animals to overcome danger, such as an evil
ruler or a bigger creature, were created at a time when large
animals and despots embodied the highest idea of power. Today,
stories of humans becoming machines, or networks, or integrating
their bodies with technology to overcome superior threats confirm a
similar attitude, updated for our contemporary society. These
stories may take the form of scientific research, sci-fi film,
literature or visual art (as in my case), and are always visual,
since <em>metamorphosis</em> in its first stage is always a mental
image. The concept of the body as data is the most natural
conclusion: futuristic bodies will be copied and deleted, will
disappear within a network, and resurface as new inhabitants of
this Smart World yet to come. But as power struggles to control
every step of this transformative process, and to channel its
energy, the masters of metamorphosis resist any attempts of command
and control (&#8984; &#9096;) through countless subterfuges. A long
time ago such practices were the prerogative of wizards, gods and
shamans: for example there was Hermes in Greece, Eshu in West
Africa, Krishna in India and Coyote in North America.<sup><a href="#6a4ccb0a">2</a></sup> Their heroic and imaginative acts fill the
pages of mythology. Now hackers and media activists play the same
cathartic role: they perform ongoing and unpredictable mutations in
the most controlled environments, and do good by cheating, bending
rules and exploiting loopholes.</p>

<p>I can discuss my work <em>THE GOOGLE TRILOGY</em> (2012) as an
example of my belief that technological power is the most
significant today, and to exemplify the possibility of studying it
(in the light of our current social and political situation) from
an artistic perspective.<sup><a href="#5361f4d6">3</a></sup></p>

<p>The series of 100 digital photos called <em>Report a
Problem</em> is the first part of this project. &ldquo;Report a
Problem&rdquo; is the message that appears at the bottom of the
Google Street View screen, which allows viewers to report a problem
during the viewing of the place they are virtually visiting:
missing censorship, wrong colors, random appearances. Only an image
that is operative, that is put within a larger system of
beliefs\functions can be considered &ldquo;wrong&rdquo;.
That&rsquo;s what happens in Google Street View, where images have
the primary function of representing places in a realistic way. In
2011, while traveling in Google Street View, I started noticing
images that could be simply defined as wrong. One image of a
building, for example, presented something like a dimensional
portal on top of it, another misplaced several elements, as though
the landscape had been segmented into small pieces and then
rearranged randomly. Fascinated by these virtual places I began
saving their coordinates, so that I could find them again in the
future. What I hadn&rsquo;t taken into consideration is that what I
naturally considered beautiful data, was in fact for the majority
of Google Street View&rsquo; users just an annoying glitch. In
fact, when I went back to those locations I found that most
glitches had disappeared. Suddenly anonymous, boring views had
rightfully taken the place of those surreal landscapes that had
captured my interest: the magic was expiring. Therefore I decided
to start photographing all of the wrong landscape I could find,
creating some sort of collection of something that was destined to
be erased as soon as someone reported the problem to Google. It was
precarious data, time sensitive matter. That was around one year
before the release of the project, and at that time I wasn&rsquo;t
sure about the end result of my effort. Collecting images (I should
say <em>certain images</em>) is also still part of my methodology,
or organizing and transforming pre-existing materials, and at that
time those weren&rsquo;t the only &ldquo;wrong images&rdquo; I
collected. I had started, for example, a collection of screenshots
of every single error notification visualized on my computer
monitor. In that case I was interested in them being fake errors,
or as Mark Nunes has explained in detail, &ldquo;prepackaged
errors&rdquo;<sup><a href="#444df6c1">4</a></sup>. This term, as
opposed to the &ldquo;uncaptured error&rdquo; is particularly
important for my work with glitch aesthetic. A <em>prepackaged
error</em> is a potential error, which is a fundamental part of the
working mechanism of contemporary network society. It is also one
of the instruments of technological power, which requires that
error is always anticipated and caught (in some kind of feedback
mechanism). The <em>prepackaged</em> serves and integrates
technological power, acting as feedback and in other words
explicating the norms and codes that define error in the
technological realm. A common errors of this sort is in fact the
<em>404</em>, which appears on web browsers in the case of
erroneous URL addresses, and that was one of the most common error
in my screenshot collection. The &ldquo;404&rdquo; failure notices
correspond to a potential error, something that the system has
actually predicted before it occurred. Thus technological power
transforms the virtual and potential opening of an error into a
systematic closure: the <em>prepackaged</em> error message that we
all receive conceals a successful operation from the perspective of
the functioning of the system, and the potential error cannot but
remain as such. What error would naturally imply, i.e. an opening
to chance and the unexpected, is annulled. From the perspective of
the system, the <em>404</em> error is always perfectly foreseen,
and for this, its only remaining function is to act as feedback,
useful for reinforcing the system&rsquo;s control. The landscapes I
had found in Google Street View were very different: not only had
they not been foreseen, but they had also escaped any form of
&ldquo;quality control&rdquo; &ndash; perfectly representing the
unexpectedness of a real technological error. With this in mind, my
diary of error messages (which is still ongoing and now contains 3
years worth of prepackaged errors) functions as a personal
encyclopedia of domestic errors, illustrating the pervasiveness,
repetitiveness and banality of the control exercised on our
networked spaces. Although the interest is still there, I
haven&rsquo;t decided how to present this collection, yet. With the
Google Street View Images, on the other hand, I knew that their
aesthetic quality deserved something similar to a traditional
exhibition: a photographic collection of the &ldquo;rarest kind of
technological errors&rdquo;: the uncaptured ones. The above
description of prepackaged errors is in fact fundamental to
contextualize both the rarity and the poetic openness represented
by my <em>Report a Problem</em> photos. An <em>uncaptured
error</em> is generally an error that refuses to collaborate with
anything or anyone and disrupts efficiency in unexpected ways. The
<em>uncaptured</em> is the sudden technological crash, the
communication blackout, the hacker attack that disables the
government website, the noise that interferes with data, an errant
and aberrant signal. An <em>uncaptured</em> error always presents
an excess that renders it not completely manageable, hence my
desire to utilize and appropriate the <em>uncaptured</em> does not
imply taming it (in fact, as I said earlier, mine is a
documentation of the presence of these errors, but similarly to the
mere documentation of a wild species it doesn&rsquo;t exercise a
strong control on the documented subject). Etymologically speaking,
the errors in my <em>Report a Problem</em> series are the perfect
example of real technological errors. As Nunes wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>[An uncaptured error] calls attention to its etymological roots:
a going astray, a wandering from intended destinations. In its
failure to communicate, error signals a path of escape from the
predictable confines of informatics control: an opening, a
virtuality, a poiesis. Error gives expression to the out of bounds
of systematic control.<sup><a href="#0ca2b10b">5</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I continued to travel on Google Street View for a year
photographing all the &ldquo;uncaptured errors&rdquo; I encountered
before others could report the problems and prompt the company to
adjust these wrong landscapes. Common landscapes are transformed in
these images into something new. In the end, the work is presented
as both a large scale photographic installation of 100 photos or a
5-minute long video slideshow of images.</p>

<p>The second part of the project, called <em>Michele&rsquo;s
Story</em>, refers more directly to the cold impersonality of
Google Street View&rsquo;s gaze. We all know that the service
offers an immense public archive of panoptic images, the result of
a systematic work which mechanically records aspects of life while
avoiding human contact with the subjects photographed. At the time
I was working on this series, each Google Street View car was
equipped with a Dodeca 2360 camera with eleven lenses, capable of
photographing 360 degrees. Afterwards the photos were assembled,
creating a stereoscopic view, and an algorithm developed by Google
automatically blurred the faces of people to protect the privacy of
those accidentally portrayed. But, I asked myself, even with
blurred faces, what really happens to the images and stories
collected in the process? My immediate answer was: they are both
ignored and put on display. My second question was: is it possible
to revert the de-humanizing approach that is at the basis of Google
Street View? To find out I started working with Michele, a man who
in 2007, as a result of an accident, became almost completely
paralyzed and had memory damage. To contextualize my choice of
working with him I have to say that the theme of memory has always
had a major role in my work, as well as the fact of collaborating
with other people, whether they are artists, scientists, or people
I had met. At that time I had completed a project called <em>The
Sicilian Family</em> (2012) that had required long interviews with
my relatives in Sicily, through which I created a memory archive of
my family. And more recently I&rsquo;ve worked with the memories of
Italian migrants in New York (<em>Memoryscapes</em>, 2015) and am
trying to develop an artificial intelligence based on human
memories for a drone (<em>Mnemodrone</em>, ongoing). Together with
Michele, we used Google Street View as a repository of collective
stories, a visual documentation of multiple memories, from which to
pick the ones that resonated with his personal story. We slowly
started to compose a sort of large scale puzzle, divided into 4
panels each presenting 25 details of images from Google Street
View. Anyone who would look at the final photographic work could
guess the story of a man going through a car accident and
infirmity, interspersed with moments of deep sadness and solitude,
poetical images and flashbacks from childhood conveying a
contrasting sense of freedom and joy. The final collection of 100
photographs called <em>Michele&rsquo;s Story</em> is therefore
composed of details taken from Google Street View and attempts to
precariously reconstruct a single human journey by recovering
snippets of stolen and dehumanized life.</p>

<p>The closing part of the trilogy, entitled <em>The Driver and the
Cameras</em>, merges the topics of the previous parts. It expands
the reflection on uncaptured errors from the first part with a
focus on the &ldquo;human factor&rdquo; similar to the second part.
The starting point of the eleven photos that compose <em>The Driver
and the Cameras</em> (eleven refers to the number of lenses used by
the Google camera) was once again uncaptured errors. But these
errors didn&rsquo;t affect the way a landscape or a urban
environment was presented; it was specifically errors in the
algorithm that automatically detected and blurred human faces. So,
to create this third series I went looking for faces that had
escaped this algorithm. The eleven resulting photos are portraits
that immortalize the driver of the Google car. Eleven people,
anonymous drivers, from Israel to the United States, portrayed in
the act of cleaning or fixing the camera. Their proximity to the
camera may have tricked Google&rsquo;s facial recognition software,
or their presence may be the result of some other technical error.
What&rsquo;s interesting for me is that the driver represents a
sort of phantom power; he appears where he shouldn&rsquo;t be and
his presence has escaped censure. His face is the symbol of an
error yet at the same time shows a human side and, perhaps, the
limits of technological power. We know from the writings of Norbert
Wiener, father of cybernetics, that in relation to cybernetic
systems, error speaks the &ldquo;language of
evil&rdquo;<sup><a href="#7ceb01c8">6</a></sup>. So do these evil
phantoms represent a menace for the system &ldquo;Google Street
View&rdquo;? Is that one more reason to &ldquo;fix&rdquo; these
images and quickly make the drivers disappear? If one important
concern of the new aesthetic is how machines see us, would
&ldquo;ghosts&rdquo; be a meaningful answer? Wiener in particular
associated <em>uncaptured errors</em>, such as the driver
portraits, with bad behaviors, intentional resistance, opposition
to the system, or the possibility of someone causing disorder and
failure. Still, the subjects of these photos are workers, invisible
but indispensable humans behind the cascades of data that Google
organizes. In Wiener&rsquo;s vision, the <em>uncaptured</em> error
is the demon that wants to see the world burn, but also the gap
that opens up a dangerous breach in the faith in the system. I
believe these errors are very far from demoniac presences, but they
strongly undermine our faith in the perfection of technological
systems: on one side they remind us that there are still humans
sweating behind virtual realities, and on the other side they
remind us that technological systems are fallible, just like
people. This gap in the control of the system, which corresponds to
the culmination of anxiety in Wiener&rsquo;s cybernetic systems,
brings our attention to the gaps or interstices of power: the weak
points in the system. It is precisely these interstices that
interest me and function as a catalyst in my art projects. These
ambiguous spaces, according to Wiener, occupied by a
&ldquo;malevolent potential&rdquo;, become my field of action. They
represent the connection point between my interest in errors and my
interest in metamorphosis. When we consider metamorphosis as a
creative transformation and we accept the unpredictable creativity
of errors, we reach the certainty that error is a fundamental
element in metamorphic processes &ndash; an idea that would make
many biologists nod in approval. To conclude, experimenting with
technological errors towards new visual <em>metamorphoses</em>
offers the unique opportunity to understand the hidden structures
of the technological power that surrounds us, while also proposing
ironic, poetic, and unexpected ways to resist its most menacing
effects: command and control.</p>
