information is like a fossil ...</h1>

<p class="by">Interview with Michaela Lakova by Andreas
Zingerle</p>

<p><span class="az">AZ:</span> In your practice based research
project <em>DEL? No, wait!REW</em> you contextualize the process of
data recovery in a forensic approach to a collection of discarded
hard drives. In the installation, the audience is asked to either
delete a recovered file or to publish it online. Can you tell a
little bit more about this work? Where did you get the hard drives
from? Can you describe the installation setup?</p>

<p><span class="ml">ML:</span> The installation <em>DELETE?No,
wait!REWIND</em> aims to explore the notion of
&ldquo;deletion&rdquo;, confronting the audience with larger
questions of how to secure deletion of data from a magnetic medium,
data ownership and the ethics of data recovery.</p>

<p>The installation setup consists of three core elements: display
screens showing the graphical user interface (GUI); a tangible
physical interface, or controller; and a spatial element &ndash; a
lit table top, which acts as one of two light sources. A spinning
hard drive is connected to Display Screen No. 1, which shows the
data recovery process in real time using open source software
(testdisk). A cold steel controller reminiscent of an industrial
machine is placed at the center. The controller has two buttons:
Delete and Save. Delete provides the option to permanently remove a
file from the system; Save uploads the file online. Display Screen
No. 2 highlights a custom written software, which facilitates user
interaction by communicating with the controller. Once the save
option is chosen, the retrieved file is saved on a remote server
and published in an online gallery. Saved files are projected on
Display Screen No. 3. The physicality of the hard drives, the
source of the data recovery procedure, is present in the exhibition
space.</p>

<p><span class="az">AZ:</span> Were there any reactions from the
audience? If so, what kind of feedback did you receive?</p>

<p><span class="ml">ML:</span> People are sensitive about their
personal data, but they lack technological knowledge about the
structuring, storing and deletion of their electronic data. Often
the viewers associate themselves with the actual owner(s) of the
hard drives, who remain unknown. In that sense the installation
achieved a greater awareness, which in some cases makes
participants rethink the fallibility of technology and what happens
when they trash their hard drives or files into their digital
recycle bins.</p>

<p><span class="az">AZ:</span> Your work calls the ownership of the
data into question. It raises questions like: Who actually owns
that data? Is the creator, the audience, or are you the owner of
the data? How do you reflect on these questions?</p>

<p><span class="ml">ML:</span> The notion of ownership is polemic.
The work is highly confrontational. It creates a moral dilemma. On
one hand I became the owner by purchasing a collection of hard
drives with a legal transaction. So the physical carrier and the
accompanying content become mine in a sense. Then I am passing my
ethical question(s) to the audience by given them a temporary
ownership or control over the content. However, this is illusionary
due to the fact that the recovered files have already been copied
to software, and even when the delete button is pressed and the
data has been deleted from that software, it still continues to
exist on the magnetic disk, which is present in the exhibition
space. Because of the slippery nature of the digital information, I
think that the notion of ownership is blended out. In other words
there are multiple owners of the same content.</p>

<p><span class="az">AZ:</span> In your work <em>Estimated Time to
Recovery</em> you created an automatized system, which recovers and
deletes files without the consent or the knowledge of the previous
owners. What were the ideas you wanted to bring forth with this
work? Can you reflect on the development phrase of the work and how
you came up with the automatized installation format?</p>

<p><span class="ml">ML:</span> The work proposes an insight to
processes which often remain hidden and run in the background on
our machines, <em>Estimated Time to Recovery</em> is an automatized
system or a feedback loop of recovery and deletion as an attempt to
display these processes, over which the users have no direct
control. The installation consists of a metal box, which contains a
mini computer Raspberry pi running open source software, which
recovers and deletes data from a hard disk. The displayed numbers
show the estimated time to recovery until the process is completed,
and a screen, connected to the pi, shows recovered images in a
random order. When the procedure is finished the machine starts the
reverse process of erasing the recovered data. The choice to
enclose all the hardware in a box is a metaphor of the black box of
our general understanding of the machines.</p>

<p><span class="az">AZ:</span> If files are deleted and recovered
over and over again, could you observe whether this affects the
recovery or deletion? Do the images alter through the process, e.g.
become glitchy or un-recoverable?</p>

<p><span class="ml">ML:</span> <em>&ldquo;Deleted file information
is like a fossil &ndash; its skeleton may be missing a bone here or
there, but the fossil remains, unchanged, until it is completely
overwritten.&rdquo;</em>A beautiful quote from Dan Farmer and
Wietse Venema, <em>Forensic-Discovery</em> serves for the
purpose.</p>

<p>When images are restored they often inherit a sign of the
recovery process &ndash; a distortion of the file, a glitch or an
artifact which is present. While performing the recovery process
over and over again, I was also prompted to identify corrupted
files without any metadata, which could be assigned as
&ldquo;un-recovered&rdquo;. Their content was blank. This also
caused some technical issues with my installation, so I decided to
deliberately avoid them.</p>

<p><span class="az">AZ:</span> In the first installation you give
the visitor a choice to delete or recover data, whereas in the
second work the deletion and recovery process is automatized. Can
you reflect on how this human interaction or lack of interaction
changes the interpretation of the recovery and deletion
processes?</p>

<p><span class="ml">ML:</span> In the first work <em>DEL?No,
wait!REW</em> installation, the viewer becomes an active
participant, to whom a certain choice has been given, but this
choice is still very much determined by an algorithm. In my second
work <em>Estimated time to recovery</em>, on the other hand, the
visitor becomes merely a witness of the process with no possibility
for interaction. I think both of these roles resonate in our
current media realm.</p>

<p><span class="az">AZ:</span> Another of your works is called
<em>Cold Storage</em> and consists of enlarged transparent prints
and five glass cubes that display the circuit boards. Can you tell
a bit more about the work? Can you describe your research for the
work and describe your aesthetic choices?</p>

<p><span class="ml">ML:</span> The <em>Cold Storage</em>
installation was made in the context of the group show entitled
&ldquo;What remains &ndash; Strategies of Saving and
Deleting&rdquo; at esc (medien kunst labor) in Graz. Together with
four other artists I was invited to explore themes of storage,
data, reliability, and the loss of materiality and values. I
started my research by looking at digital forensics and data
erasure as main themes. However, the direction of my research
shifted towards an investigation into data storage, macro chips,
circuit boards, integrated circuit (IC) diodes, and the process of
zooming into their macro structures. Eventually that was reflected
in the final work and its aesthetics choices.</p>

<p>The installation consisted of enlarged transparent prints
containing macro photos of the most common memory devices (USB
stick, SD memory card and PC hard drive) which were placed in the
windows of esc, inviting the passers-by to glimpse inside
&ldquo;What remains&rdquo;. Five glass cubes displaying the circuit
boards (used for the photographs) were lit by a light box. The
glass created an illusionary effect, which makes the hardware to
disappear. Text labels (extracts from data-sheets) are attached to
each cube, informing the viewer of what they are looking at.</p>

<p>The idea behind <em>Cold Storage</em> was to investigate the
architectural dimensions of our storage devices and how they are
translated into the physical world. While digital storage becomes
increasingly disembodied and dematerialized, hardware becomes more
and more invisible, microprocessors and components become smaller
and smaller, and chips are designed to be uncrackable. The work
proposes a poetic overview of the material quality of memory,
asking what is the future of digital storage? Is it <em>&ldquo;a
glass cold memory which lasts forever&rdquo;</em>or an imperfect
storage technology that can impart its contents?</p>

<p><span class="az">AZ:</span> So far in your works the owner is
always separated and distant from the data rather than involved in
a participatory act. Is this a direction you plan to continue or
what are your upcoming steps in your research?</p>

<p><span class="ml">ML:</span> In most of the cases is quite
difficult to trace back the original owner(s). But even then I am
not interested in personifying that data, which might center my
works around the relationship with the actual owner. Instead, I try
to keep it open for different interpretations. My next step is
producing a small publication, based on my research and the
collection of thoughts and images I have gathered.</p>

<p><span class="az">AZ:</span> So based on your research and your
artworks, did this process make you more sensitive about how you
handle data, or how do you deal with your data both on- and off
line?</p>

<p><span class="ml">ML:</span> I learned a lot throughout the
research and the process, but there are still many technical
aspects, which I do not fully understand. I am sensitive about my
data, but I am also not super cautious about it. Otherwise I would
have to become a monk. With this body of work I also attempt to
showcase and discuss freely themes that interest me and might be of
interest to others.</p>
