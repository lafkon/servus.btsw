Surveillance, McLuhan, and the Social Prosthesis: Examining the
Construction and Presentation of Identity</h1>

<div class="by">by Leo Selvaggio</div>

<p>In 2014, I launched <em>URME Surveillance</em>, an artistic
intervention that protects the public from facial recognition
surveillance systems by allowing them to wear a photo-realistic 3D
printed prosthetic of my face. When a user dons the prosthetic,
cameras equipped with facial recognition are likely to identify the
wearer as myself, thus attributing all of their actions in
surveilled public space to the identity known as &ldquo;Leo
Selvaggio.&rdquo; In this way, wearers of the prosthetic safeguard
their identities by convincingly performing my own in surveilled
areas.</p>

<p>In addition to protecting the wearer, <em>URME Surveillance</em>
also subverts and confounds large systems of surveillance through
the creation of disinformation, primarily through asserting the
presence of my identity to surveillance systems in various areas of
public space simultaneously. For example, if multiple users were to
wear this prosthetic and become &ldquo;Leos&rdquo; in different
areas of the same city at the same time, facial recognition systems
would have conflicting locative information: the identity
&ldquo;Leo Selvaggio&rdquo; would be inhabiting Main St, Carmen
Blvd, Michigan Ave, and so on. Additionally, as the body of each
individual wearer is different, there may also be inconsistent or
contradictory data gathered about my height, weight, and gender.
When done on a large enough scale, these conflicting data sets call
into question facial recognition systems&rsquo; ability to
accurately determine the true identity of any face captured in
camera-based documentation. This subversion becomes all the more
relevant as surveillance practices traditionally conducted by human
beings are increasingly being turned over to automated systems
under the false supposition that such systems are accurate and free
of bias, which we will see is not the case.</p>

<p><em>URME Surveillance</em> successfully corrupts digital
surveillance networks through an analysis and exploitation of the
way those systems function. Facial recognition technology, as it is
applied for practical use, operates on the assumption that faces
are unique and inherently tied to individual persons. This
assumption of stability when collecting data on faces (and their
respective identities) is what produces our confidence in
statistics and lends that data enough credibility to be considered
incriminating judiciary evidence. Rather than attempting to subvert
this system through digital means, <em>URME Surveillance</em> takes
an analogue approach, turning the system&rsquo;s assumption of
stability into a weakness by producing conflicting data sets in
facial recognition databases.</p>

<p>Compared to several other digital interventions, such as Julian
Oliver&rsquo;s &ldquo;No Network&rdquo; piece, <em>URME
Surveillance</em> is a relatively low-tech project. Though the
<em>URME Surveillance Identity Prosthetic</em> is not a digital
interface, its effect and execution are digital to some degree.
Within the logic of <em>URME Surveillance</em>, one is either
performing &ldquo;Leo Selvaggio&rdquo; or they are not.
Functionally, <em>URME Surveillance</em> is similar to a computer
virus. As each wearer becomes a part of the <em>URME</em> worm,
&ldquo;Leos&rdquo; multiply and replicate, confounding data sets
about the &ldquo;Leo Selvaggio&rdquo; identity. In this way,
<em>URME Surveillance</em> engages and empowers the public as
active collaborators and components of a larger network of human
interaction.</p>

<p>This idea of writing and rewriting my identity like code within
a social network has been a thematic component of my work over the
past five years. Recent digital technologies have changed the
models of both production and distribution of contemporary popular
media. With the advent of smart phones, affordable software like
iMovie, and social networks like Facebook, LinkedIn, and Vimeo, the
amount of user-generated media is at an unprecedented high. The
larger aim of my work, even outside the scope of surveillance, is
to explore how this shift in technologies relates to the
construction and presentation of identity in the social arena, an
increasingly prevalent practice that sits at the core of our
culture.</p>

<p>Perhaps Marshal McLuhan said it best when he coined his
prophetic term the &ldquo;global village&rdquo; in his 1962 book
<em>The Gutenberg Galaxy</em>. McLuhan states:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The next medium, whatever it is &ndash; it may be the extension
of consciousness &ndash; will include television as its content,
not as its environment, and will transform television into an art
form. A computer as a research and communication instrument could
enhance retrieval, obsolesce mass library organization, retrieve
the individual&rsquo;s encyclopedic function and flip it into a
private line of speedily tailored data of a saleable
kind.<sup><a href="#5ccbd3c4">1</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Especially eerie is McLuhan's prediction of this &ldquo;private
line of speedily tailored data of a saleable kind.&rdquo; Recent
news is flooded with reports of companies such as Google, Facebook,
and Microsoft selling user information to marketing firms. For
example, in section three (titled &ldquo;privacy&rdquo;) of the
terms of use for Xbox Live, a Microsoft affiliate, we find:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In particular, we may access or disclose information about you,
including the content of your communications&hellip;. Personal
information collected by Microsoft may be stored and processed in
the United States or any other country or region in which Microsoft
or its affiliates, subsidiaries, or service providers maintain
facilities. You consent to any such transfer of information outside
of your country or region.<sup><a href="#c214155b">2</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>What Microsoft makes clear is that personal information &ndash;
or aspects of identity &ndash; can be digitized, collected, and
distributed via McLuhan's theory of the global village network.</p>

<p>In fact, a recent 2013 study from Cambridge University claims
that key aspects of an individual&rsquo;s personality can be
determined through an analysis of the &ldquo;like&rdquo;
button:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We show that easily accessible digital records of behavior,
Facebook Likes, can be used to automatically and accurately predict
a range of highly sensitive personal attributes including: sexual
orientation, ethnicity, religious and political views, personality
traits, intelligence, happiness, use of addictive substances,
parental separation, age, and gender.<sup><a href="#c0ee1e2a">3</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>While it should be noted that one of the researchers is
associated with Microsoft, and therefore stands to profit
considerably from this study as a shareholder of Facebook, what is
at the center of the study is the notion that the choices we make
on social media sites are predictive indicators of how we are
perceived by both corporate America and by everyone in our global
village network. Our identities are no longer products of our own
doing. They are no longer constructed by the choices that we made
growing up, reflected upon and affirmed by the infinitesimally
small percentage of people in the world with whom we spent the
majority of our time. Identity is now created through the
perception of millions by what we like or don&rsquo;t like on
Facebook. How can one possibly navigate this change? How can we
talk about the self when its creation is now proliferated via a
faceless conglomerate workforce of hashtags, retweets, and
reposts?</p>

<p>The answer may come from McLuhan when he states in his 1972 book
<em>Take Today: The Executive as Dropout</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Paradoxically electronic man has no choice but to understand
processes, if he is to be free&hellip;The only method for
perceiving process and patterns is by inventory of effects obtained
by the comparison and contrast of developing
situations.<sup><a href="#cb4547d3">4</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here, I would propose that McLuhan is advocating a subversion of
digital technology&rsquo;s reduction of our identities into
quantifiable and categorical information by using the very same
infrastructure for our own purposes. If the Internet is going to
send our &ldquo;data&rdquo; to and fro, then let it do what it does
best, but we must control the content of that data. We, the users
of the web, the public, must be the generators of the messages sent
through our networks. We must write the software of our identities
rather than settle for being its referential hardware.</p>

<p>How we go about doing this comes from the second portion of the
McLuhan quote above, in which he describes the method for
&ldquo;perceiving process&rdquo; as an understanding of the cause
and effect of actions in &ldquo;developing situations.&rdquo; When
applied to the presentation of our identities in our digitally
mediated world, we are looking not at a passive understanding of
networks like Facebook, but rather the development of a viable
skill.</p>

<p>To understand this, let&rsquo;s look at common social practices
on Facebook. Facebook gives to our identities what texting and
email gave to our verbal communication: a chance to edit our
messages. Rather than reacting in the way a personal physical
interaction requires, email allows us to parse through our thoughts
and craft carefully constructed responses. In a very similar way,
Facebook gives the time required to present our best self. Whether
it be rewriting posts for maximum humor, choosing which photos of
ourselves to upload and which to discard, detagging ourselves from
others&rsquo; posts and photos, or most recently, using the
&ldquo;groups&rdquo; function to dictate our content&rsquo;s
audience, Facebook is an intermediary between our full selves and
the expression of ourselves that we put out into the world. In
other words, it is a curatorial practice. It is this skillful
social editing that facilitates the creation of networks of
influence: &ldquo;friends,&rdquo; in Facebook terms.</p>

<p>Klout.com provides us a useful example of this influence through
their unique &ldquo;scoring&rdquo; system:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Klout&rsquo;s vision is to enable everyone to discover and be
recognized for how they influence the world. With the rise of
social media, the ability to impact others has been democratized.
Klout measures your influence based on your ability to drive action
on social networks. The Klout Score is a single number that
represents the aggregation of multiple pieces of data about your
social media activity.<sup><a href="#7bb9ab3e">5</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>A shocking example comes from the comparison of the Dali Lama
and Perez Hilton&rsquo;s Klout scores. The Dali Lama, beloved
spiritual leader recognized around the world for his influence, has
a Klout score of 86 (out of 100), with which he influences 758,000
followers via social media<sup><a href="#33071c04">6</a></sup>. His
score is pretty good &ndash; twice my own. However, self-made
blogger Perez Hilton has a score of 90. The fact that Perez has a
higher Klout score is just spectacle, but it does highlight the
different spheres of influence that lend each figure his authority.
While the Dali Lama&rsquo;s influence is attached to his station as
a spiritual leader, Hilton&rsquo;s influence comes entirely from
his skill at controlling social media. Hilton has a standard
education &ndash; a BFA in theater. He did not come from money, and
he represents a marginalized community as an openly gay, albeit
white, man. His success comes solely from his ability to network
within the blogosphere and to influence not only others&rsquo;
perception of himself, but others&rsquo; perception of others as
well.</p>

<p>The presentation of identity is not only an invaluable skill,
but an active task. It requires maintenance and constant production
and distribution. As we have examined within this new context of a
technologically and socially mediated identity, if one does not
control the content of the message, others will. The <em>URME
Surveillance Identity Prosthetic</em> exemplifies this by
transforming my identity into tangible material for others to
present. Who I am, in part, becomes based on the surveillance data
collected about me which is produced by others, much in the same
way &ldquo;likes&rdquo; on Facebook are collected to produce
marketing profiles. In doing so, the work exposes the underlying
systems threatening the authorship of individual identity, by
allowing others to challenge the authorship of my own.</p>

<p>In doing so, what <em>URME Surveillance</em> highlights, as do
several of my other works, is the malleability and vulnerability of
identity within a technological context, and it empowers its
audience to consider how they construct, present, and author their
own socially mediated identity. Lastly, it is important to note the
opportunity to produce and present identity as a means of
harnessing collective power. Identifying that opportunity as a
cultural practice that can be formulated into a skill is perhaps
the most important development in understanding how to resist and
defend our individual authorship. To the conglomerate effect of
this production and distribution of content as it refers to the
presentation of our identities via digital networks for the purpose
of, as McLuhan states, &ldquo;being free&rdquo;, I offer the term
social prosthesis: the total manifestation of one&rsquo;s creation,
navigation, and maintenance of relationships that comprise the web
of that individual&rsquo;s network of influence.</p>

<p><strong>Leonardo Selvaggio</strong> (USA) is a Chicago based
interdisciplinary artist whose work examines the intersection of
identity and technology. He has shown work internationally in
France and Canada; domestically in New York, Chicago, Florida, and
New Mexico. He has been awarded an Albert P. Weisman grant for his
work, <em>URME Surveillance</em> and a DCASE IAP Professional Grant
to present supporting research. That artistic intervention invites
users to wear a photo-realistic prosthetic of his face as
protection from pervasive facial recognition surveillance systems.
URME has been selected for the Art Souterrain festival in Montreal,
the ISEA conference in Vancouver, and the Saint-Etienne Design
Biennial in France. In 2015, <em>URME Surveillance</em> was also
adapted for television in an episode of CSI: Cyber titled
&ldquo;Selfie 2.0&rdquo;.</p>
