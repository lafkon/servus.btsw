<h1 id="behind-the-smart-world-introduction">'Behind the Smart
World' &ndash; Introduction</h1>
<!-- % B!Y: KairUs - Linda Kronman and Andreas Zingerle -->

<p>The smart world. Created by policymakers, the advertising world,
creative industries, and persuasive UX-designers that portray to us
a world of shiny brand new technologies, apps that solve all our
daily problems and smart cities collecting big data that will
eventually solve all the problems of human kind. If we take a
slightly more critical look at our smart world, though, our shiny
gadgets become obsolete faster than ever, turning into toxic
e-waste; our apps and smart cities have turned into an effective
all-encompassing surveillance apparatus, and we have no idea who is
collecting our data, who accesses it, and where it is stored. There
may be issues that the smart world can solve, but at the same time,
it raises new problems concerning data breaches, data privacy, data
ownership and electronic waste. In this publication researchers and
artists unfold some of these issues in three parts: Saving Data,
Deleting Data and Resurfacing Data. Each part begins with
theoretical texts that address some of the concerns, followed by
strategies of artists and activists that expose problematic power
structures, creatively reveal how we lost control of our data and
offer strategies to deal with our data in this smart world.</p>

<h2 id="part-1-saving-data">Part 1: Saving Data</h2>

<p>Ctrl-S / Cmd-S, saving our data used to be a conscious act, and
we still use this key combination relatively often. When we use our
smart phones, computers, tablets or other devices connected to the
Internet, our data is increasingly saved without us realizing it.
Programs have auto save functions, apps are so user friendly that
they spread our data into the celestial clouds, and increasingly
our behavior is tracked and saved by unknown third parties. In
which ways is our data collected and saved? Is there any way we can
know who is collecting our data, where it is saved and what it is
used for? Fieke Jansen, researcher at the 'Politics of Data'
program at 'Tactical Tech' writes about the blooming industry of
data brokers who track us, collecting our data to create profiles
of us that can be sold to those who persuasively lure us to become
better consumers. She also offers some practical tips on how to
avoid being tracked. Artist Ivar Veerm&auml;e continues to
elaborate the topic of commercial cloud computing by questioning
the rhetorics of IT companies who intentionally ignore the gap
between immaterial information and the material architecture
supporting it. Data-centers and their supporting formations are the
focus of his long-term artistic research project <em>Center of
Doubt</em>. Emilio Vavarella suggests metamorphosis as the
'essential goal of survival achieved through countless creative
endeavors' as a strategy to resist technological powers. He
illustrates how he plays with the errors of Google Street View in a
series of artworks assembled as <em>THE GOOGLE TRILOGY</em>.
Obfuscation as a strategy to resist the apparatus that is
constantly tracking us is offered by artist Leo Selvaggio, who
reflects on the problematic issue of facial recognition in
surveillance. Leo's <em>URME Surveillance</em> project gives the
public a chance to hide behind a 3D prosthetic of his face. When
Leo's faces appear in several locations at the same time, the
ability to identify people through facial recognition systems is
questioned. Even if this strategy might be rather problematic in
the long run, it reveals yet another way in which our data is
continuously saved by others, in this case as images, locations and
times, waiting to be connected to the rest of our profile.</p>

<h2 id="part-2-deleting-data">Part 2: Deleting Data</h2>

<p>The second part of this publication still continues to reflect
on 'the way we save ourselves'. Writer and artist Marloes de Valk
asks: What will remain of our compulsive fetish of saving
everything? In her article the consequences of saving data without
the ability to delete it start to unfold. She describes some
effects of our 'information-hungry lifestyles', such as the toxic
lakes in China and e-waste dumped in developing countries. The
article from the research team "Times of Waste" continues on the
topic of e-waste, focusing especially on recycle and reuse paths of
smart-phones. What happens to our old phones, when upgrade to yet
another model? When our electronics start their journey as waste
for us, they might still be of use for others. Before we drop our
smart-phone in the recycle bin or sell our computer parts online,
we might want to delete the data on them. In Audrey Samson's
interview we learn that deleting data is far more complicated than
emptying the trash bin or resetting our phones to factory presets.
In her works data is deleted by physically destroying the storage
medium or concealing it, making it impossible to access.
Destruction is the only 100% effective way of data erasure. Data
recovery takes time, requires expertise and spare parts, but it has
been proven possible in many cases. Though Audrey's artworks are
symbolic 'data funerals', she also brings forth the problem of
deleting data online. She explains some of the current policies for
how online profiles are managed in case of a person's death. Once
our data is uploaded to a server in the cloud, we loose ownership
of it; while we are not able to access it, we are also not able to
delete or destroy it. Stefan Tiefengraber's artworks also deal with
the materiality of servers in data centers using destruction, while
emphasizing how limited our access to them is at the same time. In
his artwork <em>User Generated Server Destruction</em> visitors to
a website have the rare opportunity to physically damage the server
on which the website is hosted. The website goes off-line when the
hammers installed on the server take their toll on it. The works by
Audrey and Stefan reveal that the 'death of data' leaves a material
corpse behind. A rather toxic corpse, in fact, that does not decay
easily, containing rare minerals and chemicals, some even valuable
to mine. This 'urban mining' can be an effective way of reusing
materials, but it can also be a health hazard and an ecological
disaster when not done properly. The essays in this chapter connect
the seemingly immaterial information, the ones and zeros of our
data, to their material containers. Whereas the cloud suggests an
unlimited capacity of storage space, one wonders where do the data
centers go to die?</p>

<h2 id="part-3-resurfacing-data">Part 3: Resurfacing Data</h2>

<p>As the prior parts of the publication show, we live in a time
when everything is saved, and this data is very hard to delete.
When we share our data online, it often ends up being backed-up,
duplicated, shared further and sold for profit. Traces of our data
can therefore resurface in a number of places, as is made clear in
the article by computer forensic expert Dr. Michael Sonntag, who
writes about third person data, data that is collected and stored
with our unwitting consent. He also outlines what personal data of
ours exists and in which context it can resurface. We also carry an
increasing number of items on us that store personal data. Do we
make efforts to delete the data on an old mobile phone before we
hand it in for recycling, what about an old computer hard-drive,
one that we might not be able to boot any more? What if we delete
the data on the hard-drive, but it is not actually deleted? As
discussed in the previous chapter, data is only effectively deleted
if it is physically destroyed. But there are a lot of 'zombie
hard-drives' resurfacing at flea markets, in containers shipped as
donations to developing countries or at e-waste dumps. Which data
resurfaces? Can it be re-used or abused? These were some of the
initial questions we had when we bought 22 hard drives in Ghana at
one of the biggest e-waste dumps in the world. The essay <em>Behind
the Smart World ArtLab &ndash; artistic strategies to deal with
resurfacing data</em> recounts the journey of these hard drives and
how artists in an ArtLab dealt creatively with the data on them.
Most of the data on such hard drives is information junk, waste of
its own kind, yet personal data on these hard-drives raise a lot of
ethical questions: Who owns the data? Can the data be (ab)used? Are
we invading people's privacy just by looking at the data? Artist
Michaela Lakova invites the audience to deal with these ethical
questions in her installation <em>DEL?No,wait!REW</em>. In this
installation data is recovered from hard drives bought from flea
markets, and the visitor is confronted with the dilemma of either
deleting the file forever or posting it on the Internet. In
addition to this, Michaela explains about her other projects
concerning the recovery of data and storage mediums. Data is saved,
duplicated, cloned, shared and published for different motives.
Most of us would agree that spam mails and fake websites used for
fraud should be categorized as the junk of Internet traffic. It is
estimated that fake websites make up around 20% of the entire World
Wide Web, and they are often clones and copies of sites published
elsewhere. This type of resurfacing data is the focus of the last
article <em>Strategies of Net-activists Against Phishing and Fake
Business Websites</em>, in which we illustrate how open source
intelligence tools can be used to report websites suspected for
fraud and eventually have them blocked by their hosting providers.
Nevertheless, when one domain is blocked, the same website often
resurfaces under yet another slightly different domain name. This
phenomena is also clearly visible in the artwork <em>Megacorp.</em>
that visualizes a collection of 1000 fake companies.</p>
