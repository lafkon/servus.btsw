<blockquote>
<p>The ecological thought is also difficult because it brings to
light aspects of our existence that have remained unconscious for a
long time; we don&rsquo;t like to recall them. It isn&rsquo;t
<em>like</em> thinking about where your toilet waste goes. It
<em>is</em> thinking about where your toilet waste
goes.<sup><a href="#6f17e16c">1</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The research project &ldquo;Times of Waste&rdquo; is the
follow-up of our research and exhibition project
<em>RhyCycling</em>, which examined the border region of
Switzerland-Germany-France along the river Rhine. As its title
indicates, playing with the words <em>Rhy</em> (for Rhine in
Basel&rsquo;s dialect) and <em>recycling</em>, the river and its
surroundings in Basel were conceived as a network.<sup><a href="#4164d1f8">2</a></sup> We saw a mesh of different human and
non-human actors (like fish and ships), activities, and
circulations of goods. And we saw circulations of garbage and
scrap, tons of contaminated soil and toxic stones. This ugly grey
mud and beautiful colored sediments were the geological remainders
of Basel&rsquo;s industry dating back to the end of the 19th
century. They have been removed and purified to build the next
generation of chemical industry, the Novartis Campus. To provide
the citizens with a promenade along the Rhine, traversing the
border between Switzerland and France, residual lindane is still
being cleaned out of French soil.</p>

<h2 id="thinking-in-long-chains">Thinking in long chains</h2>

<p>On the basis of current network, subject, and materiality
theories, we depict waste as a dynamic, transformable and living
matter affecting and involving many actors and
entities.<sup><a href="#4a507eea">3</a></sup> Using scientific and
artistic practices the research project examines the purification,
treatment and reuse or disposal of objects and materials as well as
the actors and fields of activity involved. On the transport and
recycling routes extending from Basel&rsquo;s local context into
global connections, objects undergo not only material
transformation, but also economic, social, aesthetic or rhetorical
reassessments. What is considered waste or respectively a
&ldquo;new&rdquo; resource, when or at which stage of materiality,
is a question of perspective and interest. Our project partner, the
historian Bernd-Stefan Grewe, for instance, defines waste or
garbage as &ldquo;objects which are in the wrong
place&rdquo;<sup><a href="#22633e78">4</a></sup>. This is an
assumption we would like to agree with, with the exception of
nuclear waste for which there can be no right place.</p>

<p>We asked questions like: What are the transformation processes
and value changes of (waste) objects or materials? What material
changes do they undergo from creation to reprocessing or disposal
and removal? How are specific actors involved in these processes?
And finally: How can a topic like this be presented for public
reception using transmedial techniques?</p>

<p>In order to be able to go more into detail, we chose three
exemplary objects/materials that we wanted to trace, thus creating
an object biography in various media. We chose the smartphone,
urban mining (recycled material from buildings, streets etc.) and
nano-silver. The smartphone has been chosen for the following
reasons:</p>

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>
<p>It is a consumer fetish, a beautiful object with a clean and
smooth surface. But if you go &ldquo;behind the smart world&rdquo;,
you realize that there is &ldquo;dust and exhaustion&rdquo; (Jussi
Parikka).</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>It is designed to be dumped. With its miniaturized
high-performance electronics that make it difficult to repair, with
a primary user cycle of 18 months, and the sheer masses and
ubiquity of its presence, we could say it has already been a piece
of garbage from the beginning.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Its ubiquity, smallness, and global presence make it the
prototype of our new state of machinic being, always connected,
always hyped up.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>We were looking for gaps in the cycles, trying to meticulously
follow the paths and circulations of its components. Now, after
having worked for almost a year on e-waste generally and the
smartphone biography specifically, we have to say that we did not
expect our enterprise to become divided into such small sections.
There is never only one path; at every section and/or component,
there are manifold possibilities of its disposal or further
life-cycle. Especially with the smartphone, things seem to be much
more complicated, because it does not always follow the
&ldquo;usual routes&rdquo; of e-waste. Even the simplest way, the
legal transformations in the scrap and recycling factories, turns
out to be a long and complicated sequence of paths inland and
abroad. Despite all our efforts, we haven't been able to fully
follow the trail until the very ends of the different slags and
newly won metals. At first it seemed that this route would be so
easy, because Switzerland really tries to face the problem caused
by e-waste. When an electronic device is purchased, the consumer
pays an anticipated recycling charge of around 5% of the selling
price. In return, she can bring back her gadget at every
point-of-sale, and the point-of-sale gets money for bringing them
to the next step in the recycling process.</p>

<p>In contrast to other electronic waste, smartphones contain such
a high amount of reusable metals that they are usually not mixed
and shredded with other devices, but &ndash; after removing the
rechargeable battery &ndash; they are brought directly to the
smelter. But what sounds simple in theory is more complicated in
reality: Further research showed that, in fact, in Switzerland most
smartphones don&rsquo;t go to the regular recycling system. Many of
them are presumed to be still lying in the drawers of their owners,
although no longer in use &ndash; it&rsquo;s a personal item with
all your data, after all. And then there is a high tendency to
reuse and export smartphones, since they are usually given up by
their primary users when still functional. Where exactly these used
smartphones end up going and how they flow into the local recycling
economies is something we have to explore further.</p>

<p>Second, we found out that the smartphone does not emit most of
its waste after, but before its consumption. It is the mining
industry, the usually opencast pit mining of the smartphone&rsquo;s
almost 60 metals and rare earth elements, which produces huge
amounts of toxic and &ndash; in the case of neodymium &ndash;
radioactive waste, in addition to the fact that it depletes human
beings. Although the number of smartphone users was 1.59 billion in
2014, it is presumed that the number of users will grow to more
than 2 billion in 2016.<sup><a href="#df019d44">5</a></sup> Since
smartphones are only used for about 18 months by the primary user,
this will keep both sales rates and electronic waste from
smartphones high &ndash; even though the tonnage of garbage caused
by smartphones is comparatively low, due to their low weight (140 g
/ piece on the average).</p>

<p>This result contradicted our first assumptions and led us,
contrary to our initial plans, to examine the conditions of
production, i.e. the conditions of mining and trading metals and
rare earth elements.</p>

<p>Although rare earth elements are not generally rare (but hard to
mine and spread all over the world), this is actually the case with
neodymium, which is used to build the smartphone&rsquo;s magnet,
for instance. Research institutions have recently been putting
great effort into extracting neodymium from used magnets or finding
substitutes, because western nations do not want to depend too much
on China, which owns the world&rsquo;s biggest pit. Despite the
generally positive results concerning extraction possibilities and
their costs, there are still open questions regarding the technical
feasibility of the whole recovery chain.<sup><a href="#946c270e">6</a></sup> Thinking about future political
consequences, one of our interviewees, Heinz B&ouml;ni, head of the
Technology and Society Lab Empa, mentioned that the &ldquo;extended
producer policy&rdquo;, a worldwide standard, would gain another
dimension with an obligation to recover rare earth metals. But
political processes are slower than research findings. Also some
experts think that providing extra money for better collecting
systems, for example, would be environmentally more efficient than
recovering neodymium from the comparatively low percentage of
recycled smartphones at the moment. The far-reaching consequences
that may be caused by restrictions became evident in the US law
Dodd-Frank: It caused a quasi boycott by multinational companies,
for instance, of minerals of Central African origin supposed to be
from mines in local conflict areas. Initiatives like the iTSCi
program (ITRI Tin Supply Chain Initiative), a joint industry
project designed to address conflict mineral concerns in the
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Rwanda and other countries of
the Great Lakes Region, attempt a counter-strategy to combat the
resultant unemployment. As our interviewee Mickael Daudin,
reporting officer of the iTSCi program, mentioned, their program
establishes traceability and due diligence in the upstream mineral
chain &ndash; from the miner to the smelter &ndash; by working with
local governments and their field agents. By allowing companies to
source metals responsibly, total disengagement from the Great Lakes
Region can be avoided.<sup><a href="#06141baa">7</a></sup></p>

<p>The &ldquo;Konzernverantwortungs-Initiative&rdquo;<sup><a href="#d1a1f5f3">8</a></sup> &ndash; &ldquo;global business, global
responsibility&rdquo; &ndash; launched by Swiss NGOs in spring 2015
seeks to bring transparency to the trading chains of multinational
companies based in Switzerland, which are currently only
voluntarily made transparent and traceable. Human rights, social
and ecological standards for mining raw materials and transparency
throughout the whole trading chain should become a standard and, in
case of accidents, the corporations would have to take
responsibility. These actions seem to be a more integral way to
raise consciousness for raw materials and their global
entanglements than Dodd-Frank is.</p>

<h2 id="metals-never-die-they-go-on-and-on-and-on">Metals never
die, they go on and on and on &hellip;</h2>

<p>In short, what we have found so far seems to be similar to
KairUs&rsquo; starting point: most of the components, especially
metals, never die. They not only live on and on after the
smartphone&rsquo;s death, but they also already have a long history
behind them before they enter the smartphone. As one of our
interview partners, Rainer Bunge from the HSR Hochschule f&uuml;r
Technik Rapperswil, puts it: &ldquo;It is quite likely that a
modern smartphone comprises at least a few atoms of copper
originally mined during the Bronze Age.&rdquo; Focusing on the
history of matters from this perspective, we realized that there
are a lot of uses and misuses of a commodity and its components,
which go far beyond the original intentions. For example, we saw a
lot of migrants located at the cheap border shopping center trying
to repair smartphones and making a living by selling electronic
parts. They are no hackers or circuit benders, and the repair
options are restricted due to the glued parts, but they try to make
a living with something others depict as waste. Their agency is
similar to the people surviving in Agbogbloshie, showing us
another, more artifactual perspective in this entire issue, far
away from the usual euphoric recycling discourse referring to the
smartphone as a mini-mine. For there are always losses, but at the
same time the material cannot be erased from earth. Destruction
happens by mixture, and the components of a smartphone are mixed by
definition. Furthermore, it is exactly the modern machines in the
recycling centers that mix the matters instead of disassembling
them like the African or Indian recyclers do. &ldquo;Waste,&rdquo;
said Bernd-Stefan Grewe in our workshop, &ldquo;is matter that is
too much mixed.&rdquo; It is matter that you can no longer separate
into its valuable components, at least not in an economically
sensible way, or that you cannot grasp, because it is too fluid or
too small.</p>

<p>We developed a sustainability ranking for electronic items,
since we feel that looking at the recycling process only is
narrowing down the whole problem in a non-feasible way. Looking at
the use of electronic devices as a whole must, first of all,
include the question of sufficiency: Do we really need this item?
Even the best-practice recycled electronic item still needs
material and energy for its production and recycling will never be
performed for 100% of the material. The next point is the average
time the device is used: phenomena like &ldquo;planned
obsolescence&rdquo; are really counterproductive in this context.
In places 3 to 5 in the ranking are &ldquo;re-use of the whole
object&rdquo;, &ldquo;repair of the whole object&rdquo;, and
&ldquo;recycling of still usable components as a whole&rdquo;. Only
after this stage does the regular recycling industry come into
action, which is still preferable to the controlled burning of the
material for energy production. At the end of the sustainability
ranking we placed &ldquo;legal landfilling&rdquo; and
&ldquo;uncontrolled dumping&rdquo; at the very end. The important
point is to really understand that recycling is only a part of
reducing the whole ecologic impact of electronic devices.</p>

<p>Thus, a lot of waste never disappears, it is nowhere and
everywhere. Nanosilver is one more example of a metal that never
dies, which is why we want to pursue it. It is nano particles made
from silver; they are able to penetrate bacteria and other
microorganism, and are expected to be widely used in consumer
products that have something to do with cleaning: They purify
smelly socks, for instance. Like the surface of the smartphone,
this aspect is the clean side. On its other, dark side, they not
only will never ever disappear, but they may also intrude and
transform necessary microorganisms to a yet unknown level, because
they are made to transform or kill the unwanted. They are agents of
matter, no living organisms. Beyond its &ldquo;zombie&rdquo; (Jussi
Parikka) aspect, it is this dark and uncontrollable side of our
cult of purity that interests us. All these considerations will end
with our third object, &ldquo;urban mining&rdquo;, which is more a
question of handling objects than an object itself. In other words,
the object is the city as a mine, the process of reclaiming
compounds and elements from buildings, streets and sediments.
Consequently, all that is built and constructed, is a mine. It can
be taken or hacked or reused in manifold ways.</p>

<h2 id="ecological-thoughts-about-our-modes-of-collaboration">
Ecological Thoughts About Our Modes of Collaboration</h2>

<p>Our research team is interdisciplinary, consisting of a core
team of six people ranging from visual anthropology, environmental
studies, art theory, scenography to music and programming. During
the first year, we worked quite closely together on the concept and
the research. This intense phase of working in the core team was
something very special. We shared what we found during our own
investigations, and spent hours in discussion, trying to understand
what we were doing. Sometimes we also conducted the field work
together, e.g. interviewing experts. Maybe it had to do with the
complexity of the subject. This is different from the initial phase
in &ldquo;RhyCycling&rdquo;, where we separated and began to work
in small teams much earlier, opening up to interventions from
&ldquo;outside&rdquo; &ndash; by the ones not belonging to the
subteams. Now it seems that we have reached this point too. We are
building smaller teams for the realization of the audiowalk, the
digital archive, the object biographies, etc. The teams include
people who want to work more closely together or who share a common
interest, have the needed skills, a professional background. And we
are beginning to include our project partners more intensely
&ndash; ranging from scientists in the humanities or ecology to
NGOs and the local government and from the exhibition context.</p>

<p>The inter- and transdisciplinarity in our core team functions
primarily as different perspectives and inputs. Without our
environmental scientist, for example, we wouldn&rsquo;t be able to
perceive &ldquo;hot&rdquo; topics, like the rare earth elements or
the nano-silver issue. And she can tell us from a natural science
perspective how things are interlinked. But we not only gain expert
knowledge from one another, we also learn to listen to each other,
to deal with differences and various thinking patterns. Thus,
although we are very different, we have to think of a common goal,
and have to come to terms with each other. These are highly
uncertain processes. But in reverse, it is the sharing of this
process what lets us dissolve borders and generate joint outcomes.
One problem of this process could be that we, as well as our
outputs, are slowly assimilating, loosing the hard edges, becoming
homogeneous. On the other hand, it leads to a multiplicity, because
we have to accept that there are other points of view different
from one&rsquo;s own. Tue Greenfort once said in a talk that
ecology is about interdisciplinarity. Timothy Morton says that the
ecological thought is about co-existence. We think that our mode of
collaboration, of acting out and going through our differences and
opening them up for interventions from afar, is in that sense:
ecological.</p>
