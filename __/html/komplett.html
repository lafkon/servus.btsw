<h1 id="amro-research-lab-2015">AMRO Research Lab 2015</h1>

<p>This publication documents the first research lab<sup><a href="#99ddfbf6">1</a></sup> in conjunction with the Austrian net
culture initiative servus.at based in Linz. The idea for this kind
of lab, which is able to explore a specific topic and the
associated challenges for the information age in depth over the
course of one year, is rooted in the festival &ldquo;Art Meets
Radical Openness&rdquo;<sup><a href="#20d32f03">2</a></sup>, which
takes place biennially since 2008 in cooperation with the Art
University Linz. This is a community festival originating in the
Free Software movement and the early Austrian initiative
Linuxwochen (Linux Weeks<sup><a href="#81584145">3</a></sup>), but
this event has been expanded with cultural, artistic, and
social-critical aspects in connection with technology. When art
meets radical openness, this suggests a paradox.</p>

<p>For what is generally considered contemporary art is rarely
&ldquo;radically open&rdquo; in the sense that its authors
purposely make sources, processes and contents accessible for
further processing, as is the rule with F/LOSS (free/libre Open
Source Software) projects. What may succeed in the development of
free software, however, poses a challenge to us in the way we deal
with information. Which information is meaningful and should be
made accessible to whom in which form?</p>
<!-- % CLEARTORIGHT: -->

<p>The festival brings together a diverse group of actors (artists,
cultural workers, philosophers, software developers, hacktivists,
activists, and journalists), who often operate in different fields
at the same time (art, education, journalism, activism, software
development and more) and principally agree on the value of using
alternative tools, based on a social-critical stance. This
fundamental stance influences not only how we deal with technology
per se, but also the approach to issues concerning the complex
conditions of our digital infosphere, which impels an unremitting
cultural transformation that has a real impact on our life and the
way we deal with our world today.</p>

<p>For us, the collaboration with the artist collective KairUs -
Linda Kronman &amp; Andreas Zingerle has proved to be very
valuable. Their research topic &ldquo;Behind the Smart World&rdquo;
with its original starting point of twenty-two harddisks from the
largest recycling center in Ghana has led us to a collection of
theoretical and artistic positions focusing on a fundamental
problem of our times, the saving, deleting and resurfacing of
information.</p>

<h1 id="behind-the-smart-world-introduction">'Behind the Smart
World' &ndash; Introduction</h1>
<!-- % B!Y: KairUs - Linda Kronman and Andreas Zingerle -->

<p>The smart world. Created by policymakers, the advertising world,
creative industries, and persuasive UX-designers that portray to us
a world of shiny brand new technologies, apps that solve all our
daily problems and smart cities collecting big data that will
eventually solve all the problems of human kind. If we take a
slightly more critical look at our smart world, though, our shiny
gadgets become obsolete faster than ever, turning into toxic
e-waste; our apps and smart cities have turned into an effective
all-encompassing surveillance apparatus, and we have no idea who is
collecting our data, who accesses it, and where it is stored. There
may be issues that the smart world can solve, but at the same time,
it raises new problems concerning data breaches, data privacy, data
ownership and electronic waste. In this publication researchers and
artists unfold some of these issues in three parts: Saving Data,
Deleting Data and Resurfacing Data. Each part begins with
theoretical texts that address some of the concerns, followed by
strategies of artists and activists that expose problematic power
structures, creatively reveal how we lost control of our data and
offer strategies to deal with our data in this smart world.</p>
<!-- % NEWPAGE: -->

<h2 id="part-1-saving-data">Part 1: Saving Data</h2>

<p>Ctrl-S / Cmd-S, saving our data used to be a conscious act, and
we still use this key combination relatively often. When we use our
smart phones, computers, tablets or other devices connected to the
Internet, our data is increasingly saved without us realizing it.
Programs have auto save functions, apps are so user friendly that
they spread our data into the celestial clouds, and increasingly
our behavior is tracked and saved by unknown third parties. In
which ways is our data collected and saved? Is there any way we can
know who is collecting our data, where it is saved and what it is
used for? Fieke Jansen, researcher at the 'Politics of Data'
program at 'Tactical Tech' writes about the blooming industry of
data brokers who track us, collecting our data to create profiles
of us that can be sold to those who persuasively lure us to become
better consumers. She also offers some practical tips on how to
avoid being tracked. Artist Ivar Veerm&auml;e continues to
elaborate the topic of commercial cloud computing by questioning
the rhetorics of IT companies who intentionally ignore the gap
between immaterial information and the material architecture
supporting it. Data-centers and their supporting formations are the
focus of his long-term artistic research project <em>Center of
Doubt</em>. Emilio Vavarella suggests metamorphosis as the
'essential goal of survival achieved through countless creative
endeavors' as a strategy to resist technological powers. He
illustrates how he plays with the errors of Google Street View in a
series of artworks assembled as <em>THE GOOGLE TRILOGY</em>.
Obfuscation as a strategy to resist the apparatus that is
constantly tracking us is offered by artist Leo Selvaggio, who
reflects on the problematic issue of facial recognition in
surveillance. Leo's <em>URME Surveillance</em> project gives the
public a chance to hide behind a 3D prosthetic of his face. When
Leo's faces appear in several locations at the same time, the
ability to identify people through facial recognition systems is
questioned. Even if this strategy might be rather problematic in
the long run, it reveals yet another way in which our data is
continuously saved by others, in this case as images, locations and
times, waiting to be connected to the rest of our profile.</p>

<h2 id="part-2-deleting-data">Part 2: Deleting Data</h2>

<p>The second part of this publication still continues to reflect
on 'the way we save ourselves'. Writer and artist Marloes de Valk
asks: What will remain of our compulsive fetish of saving
everything? In her article the consequences of saving data without
the ability to delete it start to unfold. She describes some
effects of our 'information-hungry lifestyles', such as the toxic
lakes in China and e-waste dumped in developing countries. The
article from the research team "Times of Waste" continues on the
topic of e-waste, focusing especially on recycle and reuse paths of
smart-phones. What happens to our old phones, when upgrade to yet
another model? When our electronics start their journey as waste
for us, they might still be of use for others. Before we drop our
smart-phone in the recycle bin or sell our computer parts online,
we might want to delete the data on them. In Audrey Samson's
interview we learn that deleting data is far more complicated than
emptying the trash bin or resetting our phones to factory presets.
In her works data is deleted by physically destroying the storage
medium or concealing it, making it impossible to access.
Destruction is the only 100% effective way of data erasure. Data
recovery takes time, requires expertise and spare parts, but it has
been proven possible in many cases. Though Audrey's artworks are
symbolic 'data funerals', she also brings forth the problem of
deleting data online. She explains some of the current policies for
how online profiles are managed in case of a person's death. Once
our data is uploaded to a server in the cloud, we loose ownership
of it; while we are not able to access it, we are also not able to
delete or destroy it. Stefan Tiefengraber's artworks also deal with
the materiality of servers in data centers using destruction, while
emphasizing how limited our access to them is at the same time. In
his artwork <em>User Generated Server Destruction</em> visitors to
a website have the rare opportunity to physically damage the server
on which the website is hosted. The website goes off-line when the
hammers installed on the server take their toll on it. The works by
Audrey and Stefan reveal that the 'death of data' leaves a material
corpse behind. A rather toxic corpse, in fact, that does not decay
easily, containing rare minerals and chemicals, some even valuable
to mine. This 'urban mining' can be an effective way of reusing
materials, but it can also be a health hazard and an ecological
disaster when not done properly. The essays in this chapter connect
the seemingly immaterial information, the ones and zeros of our
data, to their material containers. Whereas the cloud suggests an
unlimited capacity of storage space, one wonders where do the data
centers go to die?</p>

<h2 id="part-3-resurfacing-data">Part 3: Resurfacing Data</h2>

<p>As the prior parts of the publication show, we live in a time
when everything is saved, and this data is very hard to delete.
When we share our data online, it often ends up being backed-up,
duplicated, shared further and sold for profit. Traces of our data
can therefore resurface in a number of places, as is made clear in
the article by computer forensic expert Dr. Michael Sonntag, who
writes about third person data, data that is collected and stored
with our unwitting consent. He also outlines what personal data of
ours exists and in which context it can resurface. We also carry an
increasing number of items on us that store personal data. Do we
make efforts to delete the data on an old mobile phone before we
hand it in for recycling, what about an old computer hard-drive,
one that we might not be able to boot any more? What if we delete
the data on the hard-drive, but it is not actually deleted? As
discussed in the previous chapter, data is only effectively deleted
if it is physically destroyed. But there are a lot of 'zombie
hard-drives' resurfacing at flea markets, in containers shipped as
donations to developing countries or at e-waste dumps. Which data
resurfaces? Can it be re-used or abused? These were some of the
initial questions we had when we bought 22 hard drives in Ghana at
one of the biggest e-waste dumps in the world. The essay <em>Behind
the Smart World ArtLab &ndash; artistic strategies to deal with
resurfacing data</em> recounts the journey of these hard drives and
how artists in an ArtLab dealt creatively with the data on them.
Most of the data on such hard drives is information junk, waste of
its own kind, yet personal data on these hard-drives raise a lot of
ethical questions: Who owns the data? Can the data be (ab)used? Are
we invading people's privacy just by looking at the data? Artist
Michaela Lakova invites the audience to deal with these ethical
questions in her installation <em>DEL?No,wait!REW</em>. In this
installation data is recovered from hard drives bought from flea
markets, and the visitor is confronted with the dilemma of either
deleting the file forever or posting it on the Internet. In
addition to this, Michaela explains about her other projects
concerning the recovery of data and storage mediums. Data is saved,
duplicated, cloned, shared and published for different motives.
Most of us would agree that spam mails and fake websites used for
fraud should be categorized as the junk of Internet traffic. It is
estimated that fake websites make up around 20% of the entire World
Wide Web, and they are often clones and copies of sites published
elsewhere. This type of resurfacing data is the focus of the last
article <em>Strategies of Net-activists Against Phishing and Fake
Business Websites</em>, in which we illustrate how open source
intelligence tools can be used to report websites suspected for
fraud and eventually have them blocked by their hosting providers.
Nevertheless, when one domain is blocked, the same website often
resurfaces under yet another slightly different domain name. This
phenomena is also clearly visible in the artwork <em>Megacorp.</em>
that visualizes a collection of 1000 fake companies.</p>

<h1 id="if-not-us-who-stores-and-owns-our-data">If not us, who
stores and owns our data?</h1>

<div class="by">by Fieke Jansen, Tactical Tech</div>

<p>In October 2015 the European Court of Justice ruled that the
Safe Harbor agreement was invalid. This agreement enabled American
companies that comply with European data protection law to transfer
and store data of European citizens. Under the American Patriot Act
this allowed US authorities to gain routine access to the online
data of Europeans stored with American companies, which according
to the European Court infringed on the privacy of EU
citizens.<sup><a href="#b77b03ce">4</a></sup> These jurisdictional
issues around data stem from the fact that individuals no longer
own or store their data, that third parties have become the data
holders. The question we try to answer in this article is how do we
lose control of our own data, where is it saved if it is no longer
in our immediate surroundings, and what can be done to reclaim some
control over our data?</p>

<h2 id="how-do-we-loose-control-over-our-data">How do we loose
control over our data?</h2>

<p>Our devices &ndash; computers, mobile phones, and tablets
&ndash; are constantly telling others where we are and what we are
doing. Mobile phones in particular are very effective tracking
devices: Where we go, it goes, and it records our location all the
time &ndash; even when we're not connected to the Internet. It also
collects information about our contacts, which websites we visit,
and the apps we use.</p>

<p>This might sound abstract, so lets take a closer look at
location data. Location collected over time can tell a surprisingly
full story about who we are and what our life looks like. Location
data can predict where we live and work by analyzing where our
phone sleeps at night and rests during the day.<sup><a href="#82d36489">5</a></sup> Subsequently, if location data is layered
with other data like Google maps, a company that has access to
location data can tell where we have been: whether we visited the
doctor, which restaurants we have visited frequently, and even
whether we are part of a political organization. When location data
is layered with time and data, the location can be linked to public
events, which can tell something about participation in protests,
the attendance of a concert or festival or even a visit to specific
support group. Now imagine a company has access not only to our own
location data, but also to that of all our friends and family.
Putting these locations together can give insight into who was in a
room together at what time, and from this social
graphs<sup><a href="#0e353cd8">6</a></sup> are built to identify
what type of social relationships exist between people.</p>

<p>Another common form of data collection happens in the browser,
which provides companies with insights into our interests, likes
and behavior. Most, if not all, websites have third party trackers
included in them. The visible trackers are the Facebook like
button, Twitter bird and even the advertising on the page. These
third party trackers are companies that are separate from the
website, companies that offer the website specific services like
advertising, analysis and social media share options. The purpose
of data collection in the browser is for companies to collect data
and build up a profile<sup><a href="#c990364b">7</a></sup> of who
we are: age, gender, where we live, what we read, and what we're
interested in. This information can then be packaged and sold to
others: advertisers, other companies, or governments.</p>

<p>Is the omnipresence of devices in our everyday life and the
convenience of specific tools and services the sole reason that
control is lost over personal data? No, data creation is more
complicated then that. Data is created by us as a prerequisite for
using a service &ndash; think of the data needed to register for
Facebook or Gmail. Location and browser data is created when we
interact with our devices. Other people tag us in social media.
There are also more subtle ways<sup><a href="#5ed90f01">8</a></sup>
to create data about us. When we register for specific government,
financial and social services, name, tax number, income, address
and other data are required. When we move within and between
cities, CCTV cameras and public transport systems are logging
movements. Buying a plane ticket requires entering personal data
and payment information into a website, which is shared at least
with the airline and border police.</p>

<p>What is even more invisible is data about us that is inferred
from other data. Data brokering companies create group
profiles<sup><a href="#c990364b">9</a></sup> on the basis of shared
characteristics, based on social media networks, location data
and/or browsing behavior. Our individual profiles can get tied to
one or more group profiles, binding the group characteristics (data
traces) to us. These group characteristics then become part of our
individual profile, which can determine our credit rating, type of
advertising and offers we receive. The problem is that we have no
control over which group profiles we belong to, nor what inferred
data traces are created and added to our individual profile.</p>

<p>Complicated? Let's take a fictional person, Renata, to
understand inferred data. Renata lives in Rio de Janeiro, and
spends most weekdays studying at the Universidad Federal. Her phone
reports her location from there. On Friday and Saturday night,
however, her phone reports back from the area Santa Teresa until
around 4am, before returning to the location where it normally
'sleeps' (Renata's home on Rue Bento Lisboa). A data brokering
company knows that many people who study at the Universidad Federal
and go out in Santa Teresa also browse for vegetarian recipes and
search for the latest rock concert. Based on Renata's movements,
the company decides that she fits the profile of this group and
labels her as a vegetarian rock-music fan.</p>

<h2 id="why-is-all-this-data-collected">Why is all this data
collected?</h2>

<p>'Data is the new oil.' It does not matter whether this analogy
is accurate. The truth is that there is a multi-billion-dollar data
industry making money from our data. In the data industry companies
range from data collectors, data cleaners, data sellers, all the
way to attention sellers. Most of these companies have names we
have probably never heard of, such as Acxiom, AdSquirt, Rubicon,
CommScore and DoubleClick, whereas others are companies we might
use on a daily basis, such as Google, Facebook, Linkedin and
OkCupid. However, all these companies make money on data that is
collected about us.</p>

<p>As a response to an in-depth investigation by the Federal Trade
Commission (FTC) into the data broker industry<sup><a href="#280ef9be">10</a></sup>, the oldest and one of the biggest data
brokers in the US, Acxiom, gave people access to their personal
data. Acxiom opened a website<sup><a href="#e0b91cbd">11</a></sup>
that gave US citizens, after some bureaucratic processes, the
ability to see, change and remove their data. In many instances US
citizen who gained access to their Acxiom profile did not delete
their data but changed it so that it would represent them better.
This action moved them from being Acxiom's product to becoming free
labor for the company<sup><a href="#d1de0bca">12</a></sup> by
making Acxiom's data sets more accurate and thus more valuable.</p>

<p>If our data is not saved by us but by the data industry, where
is it? This is not very exciting: it is safe to assume that our
data is stored in data centers all around the world. Our data is
stored by multiple companies, and large commercial corporations
like Google or Facebook do not store it in one location. These
companies copy and store it in multiple locations. Individuals can
only delete this data if the company gives them permission to do
so.</p>

<h2 id="what-can-we-do-to-control-our-data">What can we do to
control our data?</h2>

<p>The friction in increasing privacy and digital security as an
individual is that companies and governments are becoming more and
more sophisticated about collecting, analyzing and storing data,
while we, the users, are made responsible for protecting our data
with strategies and tools that only cover part of our digital
traces. This does not mean that we should not do anything, but it
does mean that we can only make it a little less bad and that all
measures will have an expiration data.</p>

<p>The first steps to increase our privacy and take control of our
data are actually surprisingly easy. Be aware of what is collected,
where and who has access to it (other people, companies or
governments), make choices about what data we want to keep private
and which data we are comfortable sharing with others. Try the
following steps:</p>
<!-- % VFILL: -->
<!-- % NEWPAGE: -->
<!-- % TEXINJECT: \scalefont{.9} -->

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>
<p>Give as little data as possible. When we open a new email,
social media or online shopping account or register for an event or
a website or book a flight, several data pieces are requested.
Limit the amount of data shared with companies by taking a critical
look at the necessity of providing data for the use of a tool or
service. Is this really necessary and or are there other ways? For
instance, Twitter does not have a real name policy and enables
people to create an account using a fake name with a random
picture. However, the service still asks for an email address and
mobile phone number. There is another way, though, because
registering in the browser only requires an email account and not a
phone number. Creating an anonymous email account is much easier
than having an anonymous phone number.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Block tracking in the browser. There are some very effective
bits of software that block trackers, encrypt website connections,
or stop spying ads from running &ndash; all of which can make a big
difference to our privacy. Apple recently allowed ad blocker in the
App Store, enabling us to block third party trackers in the browser
on our phones. Don't forget to clear the browser history and clear
all cookies on a regular 'daily' basis.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Play around with default settings. Commercial Internet services
have privacy settings which are often set to 'share as much as
possible', but luckily this can usually be changed in our browser
and on platforms like Facebook and Google. Remember that by
changing the default setting, we are limiting the digital traces
that will become public, but this does not mean the company that
owns the platform will not collect it.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Have multiple identities. Play with separating your data
profiles by creating different identities for communicating with
work, family, network and friends. Try creating different
identities for online shopping or use different browsers when
accessing Amazon, Facebook, Twitter or Google.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Use alternative services. When we use commercial services for
our email, chat apps, maps and file sharing, we share a lot of data
with these companies. Using an alternative to these commercial
services, will give us more control over who has access to this
data. Find out which 'alternative' email services
exist.<sup><a href="#b0cf5b17">13</a></sup></p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Don't forget the privacy and digital security basics. There's no
such thing as 'perfect privacy' or 'perfect security', but there
<em>are</em>a few simple things we can do to keep our content,
communications and web browsing more private and more secure. Keep
our devices clean and healthy, use unique and strong passwords,
install HTTPS everywhere, anonymize our Internet connection using
the Tor Browser.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h1 id="center-of-doubt">Center of Doubt</h1>

<div class="by">by Ivar Veerm&auml;e</div>

<p><em>Center of Doubt</em> is a long-term artistic research
project. The aim of the project is to explore and visualize the
disappearance and reappearance of network technology, its
infrastructure and representation. <em>Center of Doubt</em> is a
collection of visual traces depicting the data industry of our
times.</p>

<p>The appearance of the commercial 'cloud computing', or more
precisely the data centers and their supporting infrastructure, is
depicted as a turning point of a new era of centralized Internet:
big corporations are in a competition to gain a fundamental status
for their software and hardware, acting as a basic informational
layer.</p>

<h2 id="the-clouds">The Clouds</h2>

<p>I started my research by making video-based investigations about
data centers, being interested in the material, local and
environmental properties of the sites. I surveilled these technical
buildings in Berlin, Tallinn and Frankfurt. The architecture of
data centers has hidden or stealthy qualities, facilities are
blended into cityspace. Being in the background is one of the main
qualities of material infrastructure in general. This leads to a
situation where what is actually visible is rendered invisible by
being unobtrusive. In addition, there is an interesting gap between
materiality and immateriality, which is intentionally ignored in
representational rhetorics of IT companies. It is true that
information is immaterial, but it is also true that material
structures are needed to operate it.</p>

<p>Bruno Latour has a suggestion in his Actor-Network-Theory for
thinking about things -- make their role more important:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Non-humans have to be actors and not simply the hapless bearers
of symbolic projection.<sup><a href="#1b0ada41">14</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<!-- % TEXINJECT: \scalefont{1.02} -->

<p>An actor, according to Latour, is meant as something/someone
who/which influences the behaviour of other actors. Symbolic
representation is offered often in finished and therefore closed
form, which forestalls further discussion. In addition, when things
are seen only as fulfilling the role assigned to them by their
human creators, their role as mediator disappears.</p>

<p>The big things &ndash; data centers &ndash; in the cities remain
hard to recognize, but more importantly, server farms are mostly
hidden in remote places with suitable properties &ndash; like
climate, taxes, but also security.</p>

<p>I continued my research with Google's data center in
Saint-Ghislain, Belgium. It is the largest Google data center in
Europe and the second largest in the world. According to the
official information from Google Inc., it housed 296,960 servers in
2013. After my request to visit the data center officially was
rejected, I took a secret research trip to Belgium. The facility,
located on the outskirts of of the small city St. Ghislain, is
heavily protected &ndash; in addition to very strong non-human
security &ndash; fences, CCTV cameras, motion detectors &ndash;
there are also physical security guards circling the building every
30 minutes. The data center has water cooling, which produces
colossal clouds of steam. This is reminiscent of old images of
factories, but in fact it is a factory of 21st century.</p>

<p>The data center in Belgium has no visual traces of Google: the
existing signs identify the place as Crystal Computing. Ironically,
the name represents the secret policies of the corporation and also
the establishment of subsidiaries as a method for tax avoidance.
Interesting movements can be found in official founding documents
of the Crystal Computing data center &ndash; representatives and
capital have changed quite regularly over the course of few
years.</p>

<p>As the Internet is currently becoming more and more a
centralized corporate space, it is important to explore the
immaterial thinking that has not changed so much during the course
of 25 years. Previously dominant in the announcements of
cyber-idealists, it is now used as a basic language in corporate
advertising. Cyber-libertarians praised the ideology of
immateriality, non-governmentality and libertarianism. '<em>A
Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace</em>', written by
John Barry Barlow in Davos during the World Economic Forum (1996),
is a perfect example of this kind of thinking:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Governments of the Industrial World, you weary giants of flesh
and steel, I come from Cyberspace, the new home of Mind. On behalf
of the future, I ask you of the past to leave us alone. You are not
welcome among us. You have no sovereignty where we
gather.<sup><a href="#e76564bc">15</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>and:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Your legal concepts of property, expression, identity, movement,
and context do not apply to us. They are based on matter. There is
no matter here.<sup><a href="#e79861d3">16</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In this kind of conceptualization of cyberspace, which was
supposed to be a home for pure mind in its immateriality, the
mediatory role of technology is &ndash; probably consciously
&ndash; forgotten. WIRED, the advocate and lobby agency of the
Internet, concentrated mostly on <em>liberation</em>, which could
be understood in a <em>libertarian</em>sense. In the beginning, the
Internet had <em>libertarian 'wild-west'</em> characteristics, but
soon it was capitalized. The main idea of cyberspace was
communicated as a technology that connects humans, and therefore is
radically different from exploitative industrial technology. Now it
is clear that this kind of utopic cyberspace does not exist &ndash;
there is no unified Internet, but mostly various corporate surfaces
or spaces. It could be seen as a new wave of industrialism, or
rather informationalism, which is supported by huge data-industrial
buildings.</p>

<p>I am exploring this notion in <em>The Formation of Clouds</em>
by concentrating on the formation of data centers, owned by world's
leading digital companies &ndash; Microsoft, Apple, Facebook,
Google and Amazon. The activities of these global network companies
lead to highly centralized Internet access. The acknowledgement of
the development of centralization on the infrastructural level is
even more important, as user generated data is being stored and
processed in data centers that are owned by private
corporations.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Because the actual technological shape of the system is
uncertain, whoever controls its first stages could decisively
influence its future evolution.<sup><a href="#fc21b236">17</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The most important aspect of <em>The Formation of Clouds</em> is
that it reveals the competition between companies to gain the best
possible position in running the basic underlying informational
infrastructure of everyday life.</p>

<h2 id="corporate-power-and-diy-servitude">Corporate Power and DIY
Servitude</h2>

<p>To understand the backgrounds of information technology, it is
important to concentrate on the abstract notion of corporate power
and its influences. According to Deleuze and Guattari, it is
relevant to think about the concept of knowledge and its role:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Knowledge, information, and specialized education are just as
much parts of capital. 'Knowledge capital' as is the most
elementary labor or the worker.<sup><a href="#e26ef2b6">18</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Anti-Oedipus: Capitalism and Schizophrenia was first published
in 1972, when major restructualization was just getting underway,
and knowledge-based schemes began to evolve. Important changes that
supported this system took place in the mid-70s and early 80s, as
Manuel Castells writes:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In turn (1980s), the availability of new telecommunication
networks and information systems prepared the ground for the global
integration of financial markets and the segmented articulation of
production and trade throughout the world. &hellip; Thus, to some
extent, the availability of new technologies constituted as a
system in the 1970s was a fundamental basis for the process of
socioeconomic restructuring in the 1980s.<sup><a href="#fee2dbd6">19</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is important to notice that the changes to immaterial
knowledge and information were directly dependent on the material
developments of information technology. And conversely, material
infrastructure was highly dependent on information. This system was
the foundation for two principal fields:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The new economy emerged in a given time, the 1990s, a given
space, the United States, and around/from specific industries,
mainly information technology and finance.<sup><a href="#452cc648">20</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is a strong interrelation between the global financial
system and information technology: could the former was able to
develop through the latter, and the latter was dependent on the
former. Information technology became a source of development and
economic growth. These changes were realized in consumer culture,
which was mainly oriented to youth. Origins of this idea &ndash;
the adolescent as a perfect consumer &ndash; lay in US
counterculture, as Fred Turner writes:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Counterculture opened the doors of the youth movement to the
complex delights of consumer culture.<sup><a href="#fad1f92f">21</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The discovery or rather production of consumerism by various
business enterprises created gigantic profits for them. According
to Fred Turner, Steward Brand and the Whole Earth Network had an
important role in these developments. In the late 60s the Whole
Earth Network had published Whole Earth Catalogues. These were
booklets containing information about various tools and thoughts,
advertising a wide range of products &ndash; geodesic domes, tents,
books about cybernetics and systems theory, but also
microcomputers. The catalogue was a mixture of tool- and idea-set
for back-to-the-land hippies with new information theory. By the
end of the 1980s the Whole Earth Network had been transformed into
Global Business Network. It was a business consulting firm using
ideas that were a mixture of hippie ideology and entrepreneurship.
GBN made connections between entrepreneurs, corporations, and
government agencies. It supported two principal ideas, which had a
huge influence later:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>corporation as site of revolutionary social change and
interpersonal and information networks as tools and emblems of that
change.<sup><a href="#b3331956">22</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Accompanied by:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>(Whole Earth) -- Over time, the network's members and forums
helped redefine microcomputer as 'personal' machine, computer
communication networks as 'virtual communities', and cyberspace
itself as the digital equivalent of the western landscape into
which so many communards set forth in the late 1960s, the
'electronic frontier'.<sup><a href="#5fea765c">23</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>These two notions &ndash; the corporation as a site for social
change and the 'personalization' of technology &ndash; influenced a
clear move from politics to consumerism, from citizen to consumer,
and from state to corporation. The main ideology of this movement
is that one must liberate oneself. It is tricky, because one is
never finished, therefore she/he must constantly develop themselves
to achieve 'liberation'. As Deleuze clearly states
in<em>'Postscript on Societies of Control'</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In the disciplinary societies one was always starting again
(from the school to the barracks, from the barracks to the
factory), while in the societies of control one is never finished
with anything &ndash; the corporation, the educational system, the
armed services being metastable states coexisting in one and the
same modulation.<sup><a href="#8824f610">24</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>One is never finished and must always modulate him/herself
through the expression of her/his individuality. Bluntly said,
nowadays consuming the products is transformed to being a product.
Zygmunt Bauman and David Lyon have found a clever term for this
&ndash; DIY servitude:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>'Making oneself a sellable commodity' is a DIY job, individual
duty. &hellip; The goods they (who) present as 'tools' for
individual use in decision-making are in fact decisions made in
advance. They were ready-made well before the individual was
confronted with the duty (presented as an opportunity) to
decide.<sup><a href="#b33c8c27">25</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The 'personal technology' one uses is never finished, it needs
constant development. It is made for persons who are supposed to be
making themselves using these products &ndash; yet forgetting their
intermediary role. The hard- and software products are surfaces
that only function when user feeds them with information. As Bauman
and Lyon clarify:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>All those technical gadgets are, we are told, 'user friendly'
&ndash; though that favourite phrase of commercial copy means,
under closer scrutiny, a product that is incomplete without the
user's labour &hellip; not a voluntary, but a DIY
servitude...<sup><a href="#13e63042">26</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The system is based on clever mimicry &ndash; free labor for
corporations is masked as personal development &ndash; DIY, finding
one's own liberation. One of the reasons why it works so well is
found in the articulation: the corporate space, or rather the
surface &ndash; the workfield &ndash; is named as a social network.
On the one hand, naming commercial activities communal transformed
the image of some corporations from greedy and evil to fun and
likable. On the other, an ideal, utopian place, which was not
accomplished by US counterculture, was transferred to Internet. In
its beginning the Internet had a libertarian cyber-frontier
character, but it changed under corporate domination. This is
supported by corporate images &ndash; social, playful, pure, or
innovative.</p>

<h2 id="the-given">The Given</h2>

<p>As a conclusion it is important to think about distractions,
which could eventually stop further thinking. In big data based
operations the person does not exist. The personal and private
sphere is a distraction, which could divert attention to the actual
person and the protection and improvement of this private sphere.
Correlative mechanisms and algorithms deal with data in the form of
data points, fixations, categories, and their relations. These are
the given properties, which will be used to define various targets,
or more exactly target groups. Data &ndash; a record of an actual
event (textual, biological, chemical, geological) &ndash; could be
justified through its existence. Bauman and Lyon write about the
potential problem:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Data double tends to be trusted more than the person, who
prefers to tell their own tale.<sup><a href="#ac217c37">27</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Data double is an abstraction that exists only in an
anthropocentric view. But as a useful abstraction it has valuable
qualities. Talking, explaining, or associating is uncertain,
therefore it must justify its existence. This could be compared
with the criminal process, where evidence is something that exists
as a trace, whether biological, geological, chemical, digital.
Through its existence it is justified, but still interpreted
associatively by humans, who take uncertain aspects &ndash; motive,
moods, etc. &ndash; into account. But a shift to the quantitative
is happening in many domains, as Mayer-Sch&ouml;nberger and Cukier
write:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>'Big-data consciousness' -- presumption that there is
quantitative component to all that we do, and that data is
indispensable for society to learn from.<sup><a href="#d0a7a5eb">28</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Since quantities are fixed categories, mostly based on events
that have already happened, it is easy to justify them through
their existence. Big data could appear to its users as given
information, but more precisely it is the other way around &ndash;
the user is the one who gives valuable information to companies and
states. And since fixing is a stabilization, then it could
influence the potentially changing user. With this situation the
main problem is: how can one make bigger changes, when the
predictions in form of suggestions are provided mostly by
commercial companies, who are relying more on optimization and
stability? Big data could eventually reach its etymological status
&ndash; a (something that is) given (origin from Latin).</p>

<p>I explore the notion of quantification and big data in my
videowork Patent Application Data. It is an attempt to go beyond
the typical visual representation of data centers &ndash; blinking
lights, cables, large sterile halls full of server racks. The
patent drawings of data centers and their various processes provide
a purified image that refers to the most important operations.
Flowcharts, electrical schemes and machine drawings draw attention
to the primary goals of data processing &ndash; to order and
optimize the messy physical world.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Move away from the age-old search for causality &hellip; instead
we can discover patterns and correlations &hellip; The correlations
may not tell us precisely why something is happening, but they
alert us that it is happening. Big data is about what, not
why.<sup><a href="#466bb464">29</a></sup></p>

THE GOOGLE TRILOGY: OR HOW TO PLAY WITH GOOGLE STREET VIEW</h1>

<div class="by">by Emilio Vavarella</div>

<p>Borrowing the term &ldquo;metamorphosis&rdquo; from Elias
Canetti&rsquo;s philosophy, my research revolves around what I
define as &ldquo;visual metamorphosis&rdquo;, through
interdisciplinary art projects. According to Canetti,
<em>metamorphosis</em> describes the essential goal of survival
achieved through countless creative endeavors, and can be
understood as that which enables humans to resist the power that
dominates them. In his notes, Canetti explains how
<em>metamorphosis</em> is the beginning of existence, what power is
afraid of, what art should always create, and what has been
expressed &ndash; since the beginning of time &ndash; in our
dreams.<sup><a href="#7aa2b8af">30</a></sup> Indeed, a recurrent
image in mythology is that of a human, who in order to escape from
danger (some form of external power), transforms him/herself into
an animal or a plant, and if that danger also changes its form to
continue chasing its prey, the human will again transform
him/herself, in a constant loop of metamorphoses. The history of
art and literature are the richest repositories of such visions,
and today the theme is so widespread (one must only think of
contemporary posthumanism and transhumanism) that its prevalence
can be compared only to its presence in the Greek and Latin
traditions.</p>

<p>The concept of <em>metamorphosis</em> has adapted to the times,
but its essence has remained the same. Stories of people
shape-shifting into animals to overcome danger, such as an evil
ruler or a bigger creature, were created at a time when large
animals and despots embodied the highest idea of power. Today,
stories of humans becoming machines, or networks, or integrating
their bodies with technology to overcome superior threats confirm a
similar attitude, updated for our contemporary society. These
stories may take the form of scientific research, sci-fi film,
literature or visual art (as in my case), and are always visual,
since <em>metamorphosis</em> in its first stage is always a mental
image. The concept of the body as data is the most natural
conclusion: futuristic bodies will be copied and deleted, will
disappear within a network, and resurface as new inhabitants of
this Smart World yet to come. But as power struggles to control
every step of this transformative process, and to channel its
energy, the masters of metamorphosis resist any attempts of command
and control (&#8984; &#9096;) through countless subterfuges. A long
time ago such practices were the prerogative of wizards, gods and
shamans: for example there was Hermes in Greece, Eshu in West
Africa, Krishna in India and Coyote in North America.<sup><a href="#6a4ccb0a">31</a></sup> Their heroic and imaginative acts fill the
pages of mythology. Now hackers and media activists play the same
cathartic role: they perform ongoing and unpredictable mutations in
the most controlled environments, and do good by cheating, bending
rules and exploiting loopholes.</p>

<p>I can discuss my work <em>THE GOOGLE TRILOGY</em> (2012) as an
example of my belief that technological power is the most
significant today, and to exemplify the possibility of studying it
(in the light of our current social and political situation) from
an artistic perspective.<sup><a href="#5361f4d6">32</a></sup></p>

<p>The series of 100 digital photos called <em>Report a
Problem</em> is the first part of this project. &ldquo;Report a
Problem&rdquo; is the message that appears at the bottom of the
Google Street View screen, which allows viewers to report a problem
during the viewing of the place they are virtually visiting:
missing censorship, wrong colors, random appearances. Only an image
that is operative, that is put within a larger system of
beliefs\functions can be considered &ldquo;wrong&rdquo;.
That&rsquo;s what happens in Google Street View, where images have
the primary function of representing places in a realistic way. In
2011, while traveling in Google Street View, I started noticing
images that could be simply defined as wrong. One image of a
building, for example, presented something like a dimensional
portal on top of it, another misplaced several elements, as though
the landscape had been segmented into small pieces and then
rearranged randomly. Fascinated by these virtual places I began
saving their coordinates, so that I could find them again in the
future. What I hadn&rsquo;t taken into consideration is that what I
naturally considered beautiful data, was in fact for the majority
of Google Street View&rsquo; users just an annoying glitch. In
fact, when I went back to those locations I found that most
glitches had disappeared. Suddenly anonymous, boring views had
rightfully taken the place of those surreal landscapes that had
captured my interest: the magic was expiring. Therefore I decided
to start photographing all of the wrong landscape I could find,
creating some sort of collection of something that was destined to
be erased as soon as someone reported the problem to Google. It was
precarious data, time sensitive matter. That was around one year
before the release of the project, and at that time I wasn&rsquo;t
sure about the end result of my effort. Collecting images (I should
say <em>certain images</em>) is also still part of my methodology,
or organizing and transforming pre-existing materials, and at that
time those weren&rsquo;t the only &ldquo;wrong images&rdquo; I
collected. I had started, for example, a collection of screenshots
of every single error notification visualized on my computer
monitor. In that case I was interested in them being fake errors,
or as Mark Nunes has explained in detail, &ldquo;prepackaged
errors&rdquo;<sup><a href="#444df6c1">33</a></sup>. This term, as
opposed to the &ldquo;uncaptured error&rdquo; is particularly
important for my work with glitch aesthetic. A <em>prepackaged
error</em> is a potential error, which is a fundamental part of the
working mechanism of contemporary network society. It is also one
of the instruments of technological power, which requires that
error is always anticipated and caught (in some kind of feedback
mechanism). The <em>prepackaged</em> serves and integrates
technological power, acting as feedback and in other words
explicating the norms and codes that define error in the
technological realm. A common errors of this sort is in fact the
<em>404</em>, which appears on web browsers in the case of
erroneous URL addresses, and that was one of the most common error
in my screenshot collection. The &ldquo;404&rdquo; failure notices
correspond to a potential error, something that the system has
actually predicted before it occurred. Thus technological power
transforms the virtual and potential opening of an error into a
systematic closure: the <em>prepackaged</em> error message that we
all receive conceals a successful operation from the perspective of
the functioning of the system, and the potential error cannot but
remain as such. What error would naturally imply, i.e. an opening
to chance and the unexpected, is annulled. From the perspective of
the system, the <em>404</em> error is always perfectly foreseen,
and for this, its only remaining function is to act as feedback,
useful for reinforcing the system&rsquo;s control. The landscapes I
had found in Google Street View were very different: not only had
they not been foreseen, but they had also escaped any form of
&ldquo;quality control&rdquo; &ndash; perfectly representing the
unexpectedness of a real technological error. With this in mind, my
diary of error messages (which is still ongoing and now contains 3
years worth of prepackaged errors) functions as a personal
encyclopedia of domestic errors, illustrating the pervasiveness,
repetitiveness and banality of the control exercised on our
networked spaces. Although the interest is still there, I
haven&rsquo;t decided how to present this collection, yet. With the
Google Street View Images, on the other hand, I knew that their
aesthetic quality deserved something similar to a traditional
exhibition: a photographic collection of the &ldquo;rarest kind of
technological errors&rdquo;: the uncaptured ones. The above
description of prepackaged errors is in fact fundamental to
contextualize both the rarity and the poetic openness represented
by my <em>Report a Problem</em> photos. An <em>uncaptured
error</em> is generally an error that refuses to collaborate with
anything or anyone and disrupts efficiency in unexpected ways. The
<em>uncaptured</em> is the sudden technological crash, the
communication blackout, the hacker attack that disables the
government website, the noise that interferes with data, an errant
and aberrant signal. An <em>uncaptured</em> error always presents
an excess that renders it not completely manageable, hence my
desire to utilize and appropriate the <em>uncaptured</em> does not
imply taming it (in fact, as I said earlier, mine is a
documentation of the presence of these errors, but similarly to the
mere documentation of a wild species it doesn&rsquo;t exercise a
strong control on the documented subject). Etymologically speaking,
the errors in my <em>Report a Problem</em> series are the perfect
example of real technological errors. As Nunes wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>[An uncaptured error] calls attention to its etymological roots:
a going astray, a wandering from intended destinations. In its
failure to communicate, error signals a path of escape from the
predictable confines of informatics control: an opening, a
virtuality, a poiesis. Error gives expression to the out of bounds
of systematic control.<sup><a href="#0ca2b10b">34</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I continued to travel on Google Street View for a year
photographing all the &ldquo;uncaptured errors&rdquo; I encountered
before others could report the problems and prompt the company to
adjust these wrong landscapes. Common landscapes are transformed in
these images into something new. In the end, the work is presented
as both a large scale photographic installation of 100 photos or a
5-minute long video slideshow of images.</p>

<p>The second part of the project, called <em>Michele&rsquo;s
Story</em>, refers more directly to the cold impersonality of
Google Street View&rsquo;s gaze. We all know that the service
offers an immense public archive of panoptic images, the result of
a systematic work which mechanically records aspects of life while
avoiding human contact with the subjects photographed. At the time
I was working on this series, each Google Street View car was
equipped with a Dodeca 2360 camera with eleven lenses, capable of
photographing 360 degrees. Afterwards the photos were assembled,
creating a stereoscopic view, and an algorithm developed by Google
automatically blurred the faces of people to protect the privacy of
those accidentally portrayed. But, I asked myself, even with
blurred faces, what really happens to the images and stories
collected in the process? My immediate answer was: they are both
ignored and put on display. My second question was: is it possible
to revert the de-humanizing approach that is at the basis of Google
Street View? To find out I started working with Michele, a man who
in 2007, as a result of an accident, became almost completely
paralyzed and had memory damage. To contextualize my choice of
working with him I have to say that the theme of memory has always
had a major role in my work, as well as the fact of collaborating
with other people, whether they are artists, scientists, or people
I had met. At that time I had completed a project called <em>The
Sicilian Family</em> (2012) that had required long interviews with
my relatives in Sicily, through which I created a memory archive of
my family. And more recently I&rsquo;ve worked with the memories of
Italian migrants in New York (<em>Memoryscapes</em>, 2015) and am
trying to develop an artificial intelligence based on human
memories for a drone (<em>Mnemodrone</em>, ongoing). Together with
Michele, we used Google Street View as a repository of collective
stories, a visual documentation of multiple memories, from which to
pick the ones that resonated with his personal story. We slowly
started to compose a sort of large scale puzzle, divided into 4
panels each presenting 25 details of images from Google Street
View. Anyone who would look at the final photographic work could
guess the story of a man going through a car accident and
infirmity, interspersed with moments of deep sadness and solitude,
poetical images and flashbacks from childhood conveying a
contrasting sense of freedom and joy. The final collection of 100
photographs called <em>Michele&rsquo;s Story</em> is therefore
composed of details taken from Google Street View and attempts to
precariously reconstruct a single human journey by recovering
snippets of stolen and dehumanized life.</p>

<p>The closing part of the trilogy, entitled <em>The Driver and the
Cameras</em>, merges the topics of the previous parts. It expands
the reflection on uncaptured errors from the first part with a
focus on the &ldquo;human factor&rdquo; similar to the second part.
The starting point of the eleven photos that compose <em>The Driver
and the Cameras</em> (eleven refers to the number of lenses used by
the Google camera) was once again uncaptured errors. But these
errors didn&rsquo;t affect the way a landscape or a urban
environment was presented; it was specifically errors in the
algorithm that automatically detected and blurred human faces. So,
to create this third series I went looking for faces that had
escaped this algorithm. The eleven resulting photos are portraits
that immortalize the driver of the Google car. Eleven people,
anonymous drivers, from Israel to the United States, portrayed in
the act of cleaning or fixing the camera. Their proximity to the
camera may have tricked Google&rsquo;s facial recognition software,
or their presence may be the result of some other technical error.
What&rsquo;s interesting for me is that the driver represents a
sort of phantom power; he appears where he shouldn&rsquo;t be and
his presence has escaped censure. His face is the symbol of an
error yet at the same time shows a human side and, perhaps, the
limits of technological power. We know from the writings of Norbert
Wiener, father of cybernetics, that in relation to cybernetic
systems, error speaks the &ldquo;language of
evil&rdquo;<sup><a href="#7ceb01c8">35</a></sup>. So do these evil
phantoms represent a menace for the system &ldquo;Google Street
View&rdquo;? Is that one more reason to &ldquo;fix&rdquo; these
images and quickly make the drivers disappear? If one important
concern of the new aesthetic is how machines see us, would
&ldquo;ghosts&rdquo; be a meaningful answer? Wiener in particular
associated <em>uncaptured errors</em>, such as the driver
portraits, with bad behaviors, intentional resistance, opposition
to the system, or the possibility of someone causing disorder and
failure. Still, the subjects of these photos are workers, invisible
but indispensable humans behind the cascades of data that Google
organizes. In Wiener&rsquo;s vision, the <em>uncaptured</em> error
is the demon that wants to see the world burn, but also the gap
that opens up a dangerous breach in the faith in the system. I
believe these errors are very far from demoniac presences, but they
strongly undermine our faith in the perfection of technological
systems: on one side they remind us that there are still humans
sweating behind virtual realities, and on the other side they
remind us that technological systems are fallible, just like
people. This gap in the control of the system, which corresponds to
the culmination of anxiety in Wiener&rsquo;s cybernetic systems,
brings our attention to the gaps or interstices of power: the weak
points in the system. It is precisely these interstices that
interest me and function as a catalyst in my art projects. These
ambiguous spaces, according to Wiener, occupied by a
&ldquo;malevolent potential&rdquo;, become my field of action. They
represent the connection point between my interest in errors and my
interest in metamorphosis. When we consider metamorphosis as a
creative transformation and we accept the unpredictable creativity
of errors, we reach the certainty that error is a fundamental
element in metamorphic processes &ndash; an idea that would make
many biologists nod in approval. To conclude, experimenting with
technological errors towards new visual <em>metamorphoses</em>
offers the unique opportunity to understand the hidden structures
of the technological power that surrounds us, while also proposing
ironic, poetic, and unexpected ways to resist its most menacing
effects: command and control.</p>

Surveillance, McLuhan, and the Social Prosthesis: Examining the
Construction and Presentation of Identity</h1>

<div class="by">by Leo Selvaggio</div>

<p>In 2014, I launched <em>URME Surveillance</em>, an artistic
intervention that protects the public from facial recognition
surveillance systems by allowing them to wear a photo-realistic 3D
printed prosthetic of my face. When a user dons the prosthetic,
cameras equipped with facial recognition are likely to identify the
wearer as myself, thus attributing all of their actions in
surveilled public space to the identity known as &ldquo;Leo
Selvaggio.&rdquo; In this way, wearers of the prosthetic safeguard
their identities by convincingly performing my own in surveilled
areas.</p>

<p>In addition to protecting the wearer, <em>URME Surveillance</em>
also subverts and confounds large systems of surveillance through
the creation of disinformation, primarily through asserting the
presence of my identity to surveillance systems in various areas of
public space simultaneously. For example, if multiple users were to
wear this prosthetic and become &ldquo;Leos&rdquo; in different
areas of the same city at the same time, facial recognition systems
would have conflicting locative information: the identity
&ldquo;Leo Selvaggio&rdquo; would be inhabiting Main St, Carmen
Blvd, Michigan Ave, and so on. Additionally, as the body of each
individual wearer is different, there may also be inconsistent or
contradictory data gathered about my height, weight, and gender.
When done on a large enough scale, these conflicting data sets call
into question facial recognition systems&rsquo; ability to
accurately determine the true identity of any face captured in
camera-based documentation. This subversion becomes all the more
relevant as surveillance practices traditionally conducted by human
beings are increasingly being turned over to automated systems
under the false supposition that such systems are accurate and free
of bias, which we will see is not the case.</p>

<p><em>URME Surveillance</em> successfully corrupts digital
surveillance networks through an analysis and exploitation of the
way those systems function. Facial recognition technology, as it is
applied for practical use, operates on the assumption that faces
are unique and inherently tied to individual persons. This
assumption of stability when collecting data on faces (and their
respective identities) is what produces our confidence in
statistics and lends that data enough credibility to be considered
incriminating judiciary evidence. Rather than attempting to subvert
this system through digital means, <em>URME Surveillance</em> takes
an analogue approach, turning the system&rsquo;s assumption of
stability into a weakness by producing conflicting data sets in
facial recognition databases.</p>

<p>Compared to several other digital interventions, such as Julian
Oliver&rsquo;s &ldquo;No Network&rdquo; piece, <em>URME
Surveillance</em> is a relatively low-tech project. Though the
<em>URME Surveillance Identity Prosthetic</em> is not a digital
interface, its effect and execution are digital to some degree.
Within the logic of <em>URME Surveillance</em>, one is either
performing &ldquo;Leo Selvaggio&rdquo; or they are not.
Functionally, <em>URME Surveillance</em> is similar to a computer
virus. As each wearer becomes a part of the <em>URME</em> worm,
&ldquo;Leos&rdquo; multiply and replicate, confounding data sets
about the &ldquo;Leo Selvaggio&rdquo; identity. In this way,
<em>URME Surveillance</em> engages and empowers the public as
active collaborators and components of a larger network of human
interaction.</p>

<p>This idea of writing and rewriting my identity like code within
a social network has been a thematic component of my work over the
past five years. Recent digital technologies have changed the
models of both production and distribution of contemporary popular
media. With the advent of smart phones, affordable software like
iMovie, and social networks like Facebook, LinkedIn, and Vimeo, the
amount of user-generated media is at an unprecedented high. The
larger aim of my work, even outside the scope of surveillance, is
to explore how this shift in technologies relates to the
construction and presentation of identity in the social arena, an
increasingly prevalent practice that sits at the core of our
culture.</p>

<p>Perhaps Marshal McLuhan said it best when he coined his
prophetic term the &ldquo;global village&rdquo; in his 1962 book
<em>The Gutenberg Galaxy</em>. McLuhan states:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The next medium, whatever it is &ndash; it may be the extension
of consciousness &ndash; will include television as its content,
not as its environment, and will transform television into an art
form. A computer as a research and communication instrument could
enhance retrieval, obsolesce mass library organization, retrieve
the individual&rsquo;s encyclopedic function and flip it into a
private line of speedily tailored data of a saleable
kind.<sup><a href="#5ccbd3c4">36</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Especially eerie is McLuhan's prediction of this &ldquo;private
line of speedily tailored data of a saleable kind.&rdquo; Recent
news is flooded with reports of companies such as Google, Facebook,
and Microsoft selling user information to marketing firms. For
example, in section three (titled &ldquo;privacy&rdquo;) of the
terms of use for Xbox Live, a Microsoft affiliate, we find:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In particular, we may access or disclose information about you,
including the content of your communications&hellip;. Personal
information collected by Microsoft may be stored and processed in
the United States or any other country or region in which Microsoft
or its affiliates, subsidiaries, or service providers maintain
facilities. You consent to any such transfer of information outside
of your country or region.<sup><a href="#c214155b">37</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>What Microsoft makes clear is that personal information &ndash;
or aspects of identity &ndash; can be digitized, collected, and
distributed via McLuhan's theory of the global village network.</p>

<p>In fact, a recent 2013 study from Cambridge University claims
that key aspects of an individual&rsquo;s personality can be
determined through an analysis of the &ldquo;like&rdquo;
button:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We show that easily accessible digital records of behavior,
Facebook Likes, can be used to automatically and accurately predict
a range of highly sensitive personal attributes including: sexual
orientation, ethnicity, religious and political views, personality
traits, intelligence, happiness, use of addictive substances,
parental separation, age, and gender.<sup><a href="#c0ee1e2a">38</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>While it should be noted that one of the researchers is
associated with Microsoft, and therefore stands to profit
considerably from this study as a shareholder of Facebook, what is
at the center of the study is the notion that the choices we make
on social media sites are predictive indicators of how we are
perceived by both corporate America and by everyone in our global
village network. Our identities are no longer products of our own
doing. They are no longer constructed by the choices that we made
growing up, reflected upon and affirmed by the infinitesimally
small percentage of people in the world with whom we spent the
majority of our time. Identity is now created through the
perception of millions by what we like or don&rsquo;t like on
Facebook. How can one possibly navigate this change? How can we
talk about the self when its creation is now proliferated via a
faceless conglomerate workforce of hashtags, retweets, and
reposts?</p>

<p>The answer may come from McLuhan when he states in his 1972 book
<em>Take Today: The Executive as Dropout</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Paradoxically electronic man has no choice but to understand
processes, if he is to be free&hellip;The only method for
perceiving process and patterns is by inventory of effects obtained
by the comparison and contrast of developing
situations.<sup><a href="#cb4547d3">39</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here, I would propose that McLuhan is advocating a subversion of
digital technology&rsquo;s reduction of our identities into
quantifiable and categorical information by using the very same
infrastructure for our own purposes. If the Internet is going to
send our &ldquo;data&rdquo; to and fro, then let it do what it does
best, but we must control the content of that data. We, the users
of the web, the public, must be the generators of the messages sent
through our networks. We must write the software of our identities
rather than settle for being its referential hardware.</p>

<p>How we go about doing this comes from the second portion of the
McLuhan quote above, in which he describes the method for
&ldquo;perceiving process&rdquo; as an understanding of the cause
and effect of actions in &ldquo;developing situations.&rdquo; When
applied to the presentation of our identities in our digitally
mediated world, we are looking not at a passive understanding of
networks like Facebook, but rather the development of a viable
skill.</p>

<p>To understand this, let&rsquo;s look at common social practices
on Facebook. Facebook gives to our identities what texting and
email gave to our verbal communication: a chance to edit our
messages. Rather than reacting in the way a personal physical
interaction requires, email allows us to parse through our thoughts
and craft carefully constructed responses. In a very similar way,
Facebook gives the time required to present our best self. Whether
it be rewriting posts for maximum humor, choosing which photos of
ourselves to upload and which to discard, detagging ourselves from
others&rsquo; posts and photos, or most recently, using the
&ldquo;groups&rdquo; function to dictate our content&rsquo;s
audience, Facebook is an intermediary between our full selves and
the expression of ourselves that we put out into the world. In
other words, it is a curatorial practice. It is this skillful
social editing that facilitates the creation of networks of
influence: &ldquo;friends,&rdquo; in Facebook terms.</p>

<p>Klout.com provides us a useful example of this influence through
their unique &ldquo;scoring&rdquo; system:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Klout&rsquo;s vision is to enable everyone to discover and be
recognized for how they influence the world. With the rise of
social media, the ability to impact others has been democratized.
Klout measures your influence based on your ability to drive action
on social networks. The Klout Score is a single number that
represents the aggregation of multiple pieces of data about your
social media activity.<sup><a href="#7bb9ab3e">40</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>A shocking example comes from the comparison of the Dali Lama
and Perez Hilton&rsquo;s Klout scores. The Dali Lama, beloved
spiritual leader recognized around the world for his influence, has
a Klout score of 86 (out of 100), with which he influences 758,000
followers via social media<sup><a href="#33071c04">41</a></sup>.
His score is pretty good &ndash; twice my own. However, self-made
blogger Perez Hilton has a score of 90. The fact that Perez has a
higher Klout score is just spectacle, but it does highlight the
different spheres of influence that lend each figure his authority.
While the Dali Lama&rsquo;s influence is attached to his station as
a spiritual leader, Hilton&rsquo;s influence comes entirely from
his skill at controlling social media. Hilton has a standard
education &ndash; a BFA in theater. He did not come from money, and
he represents a marginalized community as an openly gay, albeit
white, man. His success comes solely from his ability to network
within the blogosphere and to influence not only others&rsquo;
perception of himself, but others&rsquo; perception of others as
well.</p>

<p>The presentation of identity is not only an invaluable skill,
but an active task. It requires maintenance and constant production
and distribution. As we have examined within this new context of a
technologically and socially mediated identity, if one does not
control the content of the message, others will. The <em>URME
Surveillance Identity Prosthetic</em> exemplifies this by
transforming my identity into tangible material for others to
present. Who I am, in part, becomes based on the surveillance data
collected about me which is produced by others, much in the same
way &ldquo;likes&rdquo; on Facebook are collected to produce
marketing profiles. In doing so, the work exposes the underlying
systems threatening the authorship of individual identity, by
allowing others to challenge the authorship of my own.</p>

<p>In doing so, what <em>URME Surveillance</em> highlights, as do
several of my other works, is the malleability and vulnerability of
identity within a technological context, and it empowers its
audience to consider how they construct, present, and author their
own socially mediated identity. Lastly, it is important to note the
opportunity to produce and present identity as a means of
harnessing collective power. Identifying that opportunity as a
cultural practice that can be formulated into a skill is perhaps
the most important development in understanding how to resist and
defend our individual authorship. To the conglomerate effect of
this production and distribution of content as it refers to the
presentation of our identities via digital networks for the purpose
of, as McLuhan states, &ldquo;being free&rdquo;, I offer the term
social prosthesis: the total manifestation of one&rsquo;s creation,
navigation, and maintenance of relationships that comprise the web
of that individual&rsquo;s network of influence.</p>

<p><strong>Leonardo Selvaggio</strong> (USA) is a Chicago based
interdisciplinary artist whose work examines the intersection of
identity and technology. He has shown work internationally in
France and Canada; domestically in New York, Chicago, Florida, and
New Mexico. He has been awarded an Albert P. Weisman grant for his
work, <em>URME Surveillance</em> and a DCASE IAP Professional Grant
to present supporting research. That artistic intervention invites
users to wear a photo-realistic prosthetic of his face as
protection from pervasive facial recognition surveillance systems.
URME has been selected for the Art Souterrain festival in Montreal,
the ISEA conference in Vancouver, and the Saint-Etienne Design
Biennial in France. In 2015, <em>URME Surveillance</em> was also
adapted for television in an episode of CSI: Cyber titled
&ldquo;Selfie 2.0&rdquo;.</p>

way we save ourselves</h1>

<div class="by">by Marloes de Valk</div>

<blockquote>
<p>When it was announced that the Library contained all books, the
first reaction was unbounded joy. All men felt themselves the
possessors of an intact and secret treasure.<sup><a href="#9928e134">42</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Never before in history have we been able to record ourselves in
such great detail. A couple of photo albums and a box with old
letters have turned into a continuous stream of descriptions of our
lives through an ever expanding amount of photos and messages on
social media as well as on our mobile devices. On those devices
there is a plethora of apps available that try to generate meaning
out of personal data. &ldquo;Self knowledge through
numbers&rdquo;<sup><a href="#cf806800">43</a></sup>, the Quantified
Self. What started in the nineties in the livecast scene with Steve
Mann&rsquo;s Wearable Wireless Webcam and the Jennicam, a 24/7
recording and broadcasting of the life of Jennifer Ringley by
Jennifer Ringley, has now become a lifestyle for the masses. Where
does this need to record and document ourselves come from? It seems
as if we&rsquo;re suffering from an existential fear, that if we
don&rsquo;t save as much of ourselves as possible, all this
precious information revealing truths about us, giving meaning to
our existence, will be lost. Can we, by becoming our own Big
Brother, reach a deeper understanding of ourselves, become better
people, as suggested by the Quantified Self movement?</p>

<p>Our hunger for information started with the shift in meaning of
the word 
<!-- % information itself [@[pp.3-20]roszak:1986:informationcult]. Information -->
<!-- % -->
 information itself<sup><a href="#0c986293">44</a></sup>.
Information <!-- % -->
 used to mean nothing more than a short statement of fact, such as
a number, date or place. Nothing so special you would name an age
or type of economy after. In the 1950s this changed with the advent
of cybernetics, the study of feedback in self-regulating closed
systems, where information was seen as the means to control a
system, any system, be it mechanical, physical, biological,
cognitive or social. Wiener, a mathematician and father of this
then new field of research, stated &ldquo;To live effectively, is
to live with adequate information. Thus, communication and control
belong to the essence of man&rsquo;s inner life, even as they
belong to his life in society&rdquo;<sup><a href="#2fa641ab">45</a></sup>, and only ten years later, in 1958,
Artificial Intelligence researchers Simon and Newell wrote
&ldquo;the programmed computer and human problem solver are both
species belonging to the genus &lsquo;Information Processing
System&rsquo;&rdquo;<sup><a href="#ebc63333">46</a></sup>
skyrocketing the value of both information and computers to a
mythical height, implying both are able to bring us closer to the
secret of human consciousness. In the seventies it was granted an
even more powerful status, that of commodity. AT&amp;T said it
best: &ldquo;Like it or not, information has finally surpassed
material goods as our basic resource&rdquo;<sup><a href="#ab952884">47</a></sup>. Bon apetit.</p>

<p>So here we are, more than half a century later, generating a
deluge of digital information, the new gold. In fear of a digital
dark age we cling to it while leaking it out of every port of our
computer. How do we protect the object of our passion from being
lost to the mists of time? We make back-ups and pray the Cloud will
protect us, for we believe to risk more than losing our family
pictures, we believe we could lose the chance to better understand
ourselves, our society, even life itself.</p>

<p>Is this fear grounded? Besides the question of whether there is
anything of value to be found, is it hard to save digital data
truly long term? We face quite a few obstacles. The main problem is
that data, even though it has a very immaterial ring to it, needs a
physical carrier, and this carrier has a limited lifespan. Even
though it feels as if we&rsquo;ve made incredible technological
advances in the past seventy years, we still struggle to find
reliable carriers. Another obstacle is obsolescence, both when it
comes to hard- and software. To maximize profits the industry has
set a rapid pace for updates. Both the machines that host, the
software that is used to create and the formats to save the data
are replaced. Which brings us to the economic factor &hellip;
storing data is not cheap. It involves more than updating and
maintaining hardware, you also have to keep the data retrievable,
and when it comes to large data sets this requires two pricey
things: manpower and considerable amounts of electricity.</p>

<p>How do you save data that is part of an ever changing and
dynamic environment such as the Internet? It supposedly never
forgets, but take for example the data on a social media platform:
it is highly context dependent and its survival relies solely on
the lifespan of the company owning the data and on its policies
regarding the archiving and publication of its content. This hints
towards the legal problems surrounding data storage. Who owns it
and therefore has control over it? Most social media platforms, for
example, have no legal obligation towards their users, and have
complete ownership of the data users provide them with. And if it
didn&rsquo;t prove to be enough of a challenge to overcome all
these obstacles, there is the issue of data proliferation: the
shear amount of data we&rsquo;re trying to save is absolutely
phenomenal and ever increasing.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re obsessed. Our data bodies morbidly obese. Metaphors
like the cloud promise infinite liposuction, delegating the storage
of our excesses to what seems like outer space. It feels as if
there is no need to be selective, storage space seems limitless to
individuals, we are offered free storage just about everywhere, at
no cost. And in the end, most of us trust there will be a
technological solution offered to solve the aforementioned issues.
Perhaps our indifference is in part influenced by the way we
describe technology. Putting your data in the Cloud sounds like a
perfect solution, it has beautiful connotations: safe, clean,
lightweight, natural. The Cloud metaphor hides the uglier and
riskier reality of data centers filled with energy-consuming,
heat-producing, maintenance-hungry servers. Other metaphors, such
as Data mining and Data streams, compare data to naturally
occurring physical resources, seemingly inexhaustible and ready for
exploitation in the name of economic growth and private gain. They
mask the human aspect of it, the fact that most of it is personal,
something we would be more hesitant to have 
<!-- % exploited.[@hwanglevy:2015:metaphors] Other metaphors, such as open -->
<!-- % -->
 exploited.<sup><a href="#a0c1d55b">48</a></sup> Other metaphors,
such as open <!-- % -->
 data and software transparency have strong connotations of trust.
If everything is open and transparent, everyone will behave
honestly. But the sheer amount of online scams show transparency is
no guarantee, hiding in plain sight is easy in an environment where
real and fake are indistinguishable. The Cloud, data mining,
transparency and openness, these metaphors hide the darker effects
of our obsession: the privacy we&rsquo;ve lost, but also the fact
that information is not immaterial, the waste we produce, the
electricity that is consumed all have a real impact.</p>

<p>Our connected and information-hungry lifestyles feel as clean as
the design of our latest gadget, but that is only because we export
many of the dirtier sides of it to the less privileged parts of the
world, where labor is cheap and there is limited regulatory
oversight into health, safety and environmental impact. Near Baotou
in China, for instance, the effects are clearly visible and took
the shape of an artificial toxic lake of black sludge, the result
of mining to create our tech 
<!-- % gadgets.[@maughan:2015:dystopianlake] China is also home to one of -->
 gadgets.<sup><a href="#5768b1da">49</a></sup> China is also home
to one of the largest dumps of e-waste in the world, which not
coincidentally is also one of the most polluted places on earth:
Guiyu. Despite strict regulations, loopholes have been found and
illegal dumping of e-waste in countries such as Ghana and China is
still happening under the guise of aid or second hand goods. In
2010 as much as 75% of the 8.7 million tons of e-waste generated in
the EU could not be accounted for, despite regulations. In the US
the figure is said to have been about 80%.<sup><a href="#629c4254">50</a></sup> Only because we&rsquo;re running out of
certain metals and mining them becomes increasingly costly, have we
begun to recycle old hardware in the developed world. Initiatives
like &ldquo;Closing The Loop&rdquo; are buying and recycling old
mobile phones from the countries we previously used as a dump.
After decades of poisoning, we are back at mining for gold, perhaps
diminishing pollution, but keeping the economic inequality intact.
From poor working conditions in electronics manufacturing plants
and e-waste pollution to energy-hungry server farms and our loss of
privacy, the disastrous effects of our lifestyles can be felt on so
many levels it hurts to think about it, and that is probably why we
don&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>We consume information at high speed but forget even faster,
repeating the same behavior as if the news has been overwritten
with Internet memes and enhanced photos of our latest attempt at
cooking. The real treasures in this tsunami of data are the ones
that give us a chance to see past tomorrow, to see the long term
consequences of our choices, the big picture. But all that most of
us can still distinguish is noise. Future historians can go in
search for the big ideas of our time inside what is left of the
machines we&rsquo;ve build to keep our treasure. They might analyze
what is left of the data we&rsquo;ve produced. One idea of our time
will surely remain, our information fetishism.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The ecological thought is also difficult because it brings to
light aspects of our existence that have remained unconscious for a
long time; we don&rsquo;t like to recall them. It isn&rsquo;t
<em>like</em> thinking about where your toilet waste goes. It
<em>is</em> thinking about where your toilet waste
goes.<sup><a href="#6f17e16c">51</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The research project &ldquo;Times of Waste&rdquo; is the
follow-up of our research and exhibition project
<em>RhyCycling</em>, which examined the border region of
Switzerland-Germany-France along the river Rhine. As its title
indicates, playing with the words <em>Rhy</em> (for Rhine in
Basel&rsquo;s dialect) and <em>recycling</em>, the river and its
surroundings in Basel were conceived as a network.<sup><a href="#4164d1f8">52</a></sup> We saw a mesh of different human and
non-human actors (like fish and ships), activities, and
circulations of goods. And we saw circulations of garbage and
scrap, tons of contaminated soil and toxic stones. This ugly grey
mud and beautiful colored sediments were the geological remainders
of Basel&rsquo;s industry dating back to the end of the 19th
century. They have been removed and purified to build the next
generation of chemical industry, the Novartis Campus. To provide
the citizens with a promenade along the Rhine, traversing the
border between Switzerland and France, residual lindane is still
being cleaned out of French soil.</p>

<h2 id="thinking-in-long-chains">Thinking in long chains</h2>

<p>On the basis of current network, subject, and materiality
theories, we depict waste as a dynamic, transformable and living
matter affecting and involving many actors and
entities.<sup><a href="#4a507eea">53</a></sup> Using scientific and
artistic practices the research project examines the purification,
treatment and reuse or disposal of objects and materials as well as
the actors and fields of activity involved. On the transport and
recycling routes extending from Basel&rsquo;s local context into
global connections, objects undergo not only material
transformation, but also economic, social, aesthetic or rhetorical
reassessments. What is considered waste or respectively a
&ldquo;new&rdquo; resource, when or at which stage of materiality,
is a question of perspective and interest. Our project partner, the
historian Bernd-Stefan Grewe, for instance, defines waste or
garbage as &ldquo;objects which are in the wrong
place&rdquo;<sup><a href="#22633e78">54</a></sup>. This is an
assumption we would like to agree with, with the exception of
nuclear waste for which there can be no right place.</p>

<p>We asked questions like: What are the transformation processes
and value changes of (waste) objects or materials? What material
changes do they undergo from creation to reprocessing or disposal
and removal? How are specific actors involved in these processes?
And finally: How can a topic like this be presented for public
reception using transmedial techniques?</p>

<p>In order to be able to go more into detail, we chose three
exemplary objects/materials that we wanted to trace, thus creating
an object biography in various media. We chose the smartphone,
urban mining (recycled material from buildings, streets etc.) and
nano-silver. The smartphone has been chosen for the following
reasons:</p>

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>
<p>It is a consumer fetish, a beautiful object with a clean and
smooth surface. But if you go &ldquo;behind the smart world&rdquo;,
you realize that there is &ldquo;dust and exhaustion&rdquo; (Jussi
Parikka).</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>It is designed to be dumped. With its miniaturized
high-performance electronics that make it difficult to repair, with
a primary user cycle of 18 months, and the sheer masses and
ubiquity of its presence, we could say it has already been a piece
of garbage from the beginning.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Its ubiquity, smallness, and global presence make it the
prototype of our new state of machinic being, always connected,
always hyped up.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>We were looking for gaps in the cycles, trying to meticulously
follow the paths and circulations of its components. Now, after
having worked for almost a year on e-waste generally and the
smartphone biography specifically, we have to say that we did not
expect our enterprise to become divided into such small sections.
There is never only one path; at every section and/or component,
there are manifold possibilities of its disposal or further
life-cycle. Especially with the smartphone, things seem to be much
more complicated, because it does not always follow the
&ldquo;usual routes&rdquo; of e-waste. Even the simplest way, the
legal transformations in the scrap and recycling factories, turns
out to be a long and complicated sequence of paths inland and
abroad. Despite all our efforts, we haven't been able to fully
follow the trail until the very ends of the different slags and
newly won metals. At first it seemed that this route would be so
easy, because Switzerland really tries to face the problem caused
by e-waste. When an electronic device is purchased, the consumer
pays an anticipated recycling charge of around 5% of the selling
price. In return, she can bring back her gadget at every
point-of-sale, and the point-of-sale gets money for bringing them
to the next step in the recycling process.</p>

<p>In contrast to other electronic waste, smartphones contain such
a high amount of reusable metals that they are usually not mixed
and shredded with other devices, but &ndash; after removing the
rechargeable battery &ndash; they are brought directly to the
smelter. But what sounds simple in theory is more complicated in
reality: Further research showed that, in fact, in Switzerland most
smartphones don&rsquo;t go to the regular recycling system. Many of
them are presumed to be still lying in the drawers of their owners,
although no longer in use &ndash; it&rsquo;s a personal item with
all your data, after all. And then there is a high tendency to
reuse and export smartphones, since they are usually given up by
their primary users when still functional. Where exactly these used
smartphones end up going and how they flow into the local recycling
economies is something we have to explore further.</p>

<p>Second, we found out that the smartphone does not emit most of
its waste after, but before its consumption. It is the mining
industry, the usually opencast pit mining of the smartphone&rsquo;s
almost 60 metals and rare earth elements, which produces huge
amounts of toxic and &ndash; in the case of neodymium &ndash;
radioactive waste, in addition to the fact that it depletes human
beings. Although the number of smartphone users was 1.59 billion in
2014, it is presumed that the number of users will grow to more
than 2 billion in 2016.<sup><a href="#df019d44">55</a></sup> Since
smartphones are only used for about 18 months by the primary user,
this will keep both sales rates and electronic waste from
smartphones high &ndash; even though the tonnage of garbage caused
by smartphones is comparatively low, due to their low weight (140 g
/ piece on the average).</p>

<p>This result contradicted our first assumptions and led us,
contrary to our initial plans, to examine the conditions of
production, i.e. the conditions of mining and trading metals and
rare earth elements.</p>

<p>Although rare earth elements are not generally rare (but hard to
mine and spread all over the world), this is actually the case with
neodymium, which is used to build the smartphone&rsquo;s magnet,
for instance. Research institutions have recently been putting
great effort into extracting neodymium from used magnets or finding
substitutes, because western nations do not want to depend too much
on China, which owns the world&rsquo;s biggest pit. Despite the
generally positive results concerning extraction possibilities and
their costs, there are still open questions regarding the technical
feasibility of the whole recovery chain.<sup><a href="#946c270e">56</a></sup> Thinking about future political
consequences, one of our interviewees, Heinz B&ouml;ni, head of the
Technology and Society Lab Empa, mentioned that the &ldquo;extended
producer policy&rdquo;, a worldwide standard, would gain another
dimension with an obligation to recover rare earth metals. But
political processes are slower than research findings. Also some
experts think that providing extra money for better collecting
systems, for example, would be environmentally more efficient than
recovering neodymium from the comparatively low percentage of
recycled smartphones at the moment. The far-reaching consequences
that may be caused by restrictions became evident in the US law
Dodd-Frank: It caused a quasi boycott by multinational companies,
for instance, of minerals of Central African origin supposed to be
from mines in local conflict areas. Initiatives like the iTSCi
program (ITRI Tin Supply Chain Initiative), a joint industry
project designed to address conflict mineral concerns in the
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Rwanda and other countries of
the Great Lakes Region, attempt a counter-strategy to combat the
resultant unemployment. As our interviewee Mickael Daudin,
reporting officer of the iTSCi program, mentioned, their program
establishes traceability and due diligence in the upstream mineral
chain &ndash; from the miner to the smelter &ndash; by working with
local governments and their field agents. By allowing companies to
source metals responsibly, total disengagement from the Great Lakes
Region can be avoided.<sup><a href="#06141baa">57</a></sup></p>

<p>The &ldquo;Konzernverantwortungs-Initiative&rdquo;<sup><a href="#d1a1f5f3">58</a></sup> &ndash; &ldquo;global business, global
responsibility&rdquo; &ndash; launched by Swiss NGOs in spring 2015
seeks to bring transparency to the trading chains of multinational
companies based in Switzerland, which are currently only
voluntarily made transparent and traceable. Human rights, social
and ecological standards for mining raw materials and transparency
throughout the whole trading chain should become a standard and, in
case of accidents, the corporations would have to take
responsibility. These actions seem to be a more integral way to
raise consciousness for raw materials and their global
entanglements than Dodd-Frank is.</p>

<h2 id="metals-never-die-they-go-on-and-on-and-on">Metals never
die, they go on and on and on &hellip;</h2>

<p>In short, what we have found so far seems to be similar to
KairUs&rsquo; starting point: most of the components, especially
metals, never die. They not only live on and on after the
smartphone&rsquo;s death, but they also already have a long history
behind them before they enter the smartphone. As one of our
interview partners, Rainer Bunge from the HSR Hochschule f&uuml;r
Technik Rapperswil, puts it: &ldquo;It is quite likely that a
modern smartphone comprises at least a few atoms of copper
originally mined during the Bronze Age.&rdquo; Focusing on the
history of matters from this perspective, we realized that there
are a lot of uses and misuses of a commodity and its components,
which go far beyond the original intentions. For example, we saw a
lot of migrants located at the cheap border shopping center trying
to repair smartphones and making a living by selling electronic
parts. They are no hackers or circuit benders, and the repair
options are restricted due to the glued parts, but they try to make
a living with something others depict as waste. Their agency is
similar to the people surviving in Agbogbloshie, showing us
another, more artifactual perspective in this entire issue, far
away from the usual euphoric recycling discourse referring to the
smartphone as a mini-mine. For there are always losses, but at the
same time the material cannot be erased from earth. Destruction
happens by mixture, and the components of a smartphone are mixed by
definition. Furthermore, it is exactly the modern machines in the
recycling centers that mix the matters instead of disassembling
them like the African or Indian recyclers do. &ldquo;Waste,&rdquo;
said Bernd-Stefan Grewe in our workshop, &ldquo;is matter that is
too much mixed.&rdquo; It is matter that you can no longer separate
into its valuable components, at least not in an economically
sensible way, or that you cannot grasp, because it is too fluid or
too small.</p>

<p>We developed a sustainability ranking for electronic items,
since we feel that looking at the recycling process only is
narrowing down the whole problem in a non-feasible way. Looking at
the use of electronic devices as a whole must, first of all,
include the question of sufficiency: Do we really need this item?
Even the best-practice recycled electronic item still needs
material and energy for its production and recycling will never be
performed for 100% of the material. The next point is the average
time the device is used: phenomena like &ldquo;planned
obsolescence&rdquo; are really counterproductive in this context.
In places 3 to 5 in the ranking are &ldquo;re-use of the whole
object&rdquo;, &ldquo;repair of the whole object&rdquo;, and
&ldquo;recycling of still usable components as a whole&rdquo;. Only
after this stage does the regular recycling industry come into
action, which is still preferable to the controlled burning of the
material for energy production. At the end of the sustainability
ranking we placed &ldquo;legal landfilling&rdquo; and
&ldquo;uncontrolled dumping&rdquo; at the very end. The important
point is to really understand that recycling is only a part of
reducing the whole ecologic impact of electronic devices.</p>

<p>Thus, a lot of waste never disappears, it is nowhere and
everywhere. Nanosilver is one more example of a metal that never
dies, which is why we want to pursue it. It is nano particles made
from silver; they are able to penetrate bacteria and other
microorganism, and are expected to be widely used in consumer
products that have something to do with cleaning: They purify
smelly socks, for instance. Like the surface of the smartphone,
this aspect is the clean side. On its other, dark side, they not
only will never ever disappear, but they may also intrude and
transform necessary microorganisms to a yet unknown level, because
they are made to transform or kill the unwanted. They are agents of
matter, no living organisms. Beyond its &ldquo;zombie&rdquo; (Jussi
Parikka) aspect, it is this dark and uncontrollable side of our
cult of purity that interests us. All these considerations will end
with our third object, &ldquo;urban mining&rdquo;, which is more a
question of handling objects than an object itself. In other words,
the object is the city as a mine, the process of reclaiming
compounds and elements from buildings, streets and sediments.
Consequently, all that is built and constructed, is a mine. It can
be taken or hacked or reused in manifold ways.</p>

<h2 id="ecological-thoughts-about-our-modes-of-collaboration">
Ecological Thoughts About Our Modes of Collaboration</h2>

<p>Our research team is interdisciplinary, consisting of a core
team of six people ranging from visual anthropology, environmental
studies, art theory, scenography to music and programming. During
the first year, we worked quite closely together on the concept and
the research. This intense phase of working in the core team was
something very special. We shared what we found during our own
investigations, and spent hours in discussion, trying to understand
what we were doing. Sometimes we also conducted the field work
together, e.g. interviewing experts. Maybe it had to do with the
complexity of the subject. This is different from the initial phase
in &ldquo;RhyCycling&rdquo;, where we separated and began to work
in small teams much earlier, opening up to interventions from
&ldquo;outside&rdquo; &ndash; by the ones not belonging to the
subteams. Now it seems that we have reached this point too. We are
building smaller teams for the realization of the audiowalk, the
digital archive, the object biographies, etc. The teams include
people who want to work more closely together or who share a common
interest, have the needed skills, a professional background. And we
are beginning to include our project partners more intensely
&ndash; ranging from scientists in the humanities or ecology to
NGOs and the local government and from the exhibition context.</p>

<p>The inter- and transdisciplinarity in our core team functions
primarily as different perspectives and inputs. Without our
environmental scientist, for example, we wouldn&rsquo;t be able to
perceive &ldquo;hot&rdquo; topics, like the rare earth elements or
the nano-silver issue. And she can tell us from a natural science
perspective how things are interlinked. But we not only gain expert
knowledge from one another, we also learn to listen to each other,
to deal with differences and various thinking patterns. Thus,
although we are very different, we have to think of a common goal,
and have to come to terms with each other. These are highly
uncertain processes. But in reverse, it is the sharing of this
process what lets us dissolve borders and generate joint outcomes.
One problem of this process could be that we, as well as our
outputs, are slowly assimilating, loosing the hard edges, becoming
homogeneous. On the other hand, it leads to a multiplicity, because
we have to accept that there are other points of view different
from one&rsquo;s own. Tue Greenfort once said in a talk that
ecology is about interdisciplinarity. Timothy Morton says that the
ecological thought is about co-existence. We think that our mode of
collaboration, of acting out and going through our differences and
opening them up for interventions from afar, is in that sense:
ecological.</p>

<p class="by">Interview with Audrey Samson by Linda Kronman</p>

<p><span class="lk">LK:</span> Your works
<em>ne.me.quitte(s).pas</em><sup><a href="#fd0fd1e2">59</a></sup>
(do not leave me) and <em>Goodnight Sweetheart</em><sup><a href="#a3f8ddb9">60</a></sup> can both be seen as digital data funerals
and artistic strategies to deal with the deletion of data. Yet in
your research you talk about the difficulties of deleting data,
specially in the case of Facebook, Google and Twitter. How hard or
easy is it to erase data once uploaded in the circulation of social
media?</p>

<p><span class="as">AS:</span> Yes, both works are about erasing
data, but as you say it is rather impossible, so in the works the
gesture is very symbolic. How difficult is it to erase data? I
think it is nearly impossible, especially online. When one's data
is uploaded to the cloud, we normally don't know where the server
is, and the only real way to destroy data, is by physically
destroying the hardware, by de-magnetizing it or smashing it.
Obviously you can't march over to Google somewhere in California
and say &ndash; I would like to smash my section. And even if you
could, because of how things are copied and propagated through the
network, deleting data is practically impossible.</p>

<p><span class="lk">LK:</span> Another thing you have written about
is issues of data ownership after a person's death. What are the
current policies of the major social media platforms handling one's
digital legacy after death?</p>

<p><span class="as">AS:</span> These policies change very quickly,
so hopefully what I say is current, but it might be six months or a
year old. For example Facebook recently implemented the 'Legacy
Contact', which is not available in all countries yet, but
definitely in the US and DK. If you have Facebook, in your profile
settings you may designate the person who would be your legacy
contact. This person may update your profile picture and add new
friends, also download a copy of your Facebook data. You used to be
able to choose whether your account should be deleted or
memorialized (upon proof of death). But of course deleted is again
a big word, because they don't really delete the data. Even if they
delete your profile data, your ID still exists, and all your data
still exist, shared through other peoples profiles.</p>

<p><span class="lk">LK:</span> What happens in practice when the
profile does not appear anymore? Will the persons be deleted from
the friend lists etc.?</p>

<p><span class="as">AS:</span> This is very recent so there hasn't
been much testing on it. So it should be that it takes you off all
those lists. But in the past when profiles have been 'taken off',
they have still appeared in e.g. birthday reminders. Or they have
this new thing 'your memories', and this has been very troublesome
for some people, because for example their dead brother appears in
'the memories' one morning, so there is this kind of ghost in the
machine that lingers on.</p>

<p>With Google it is not really a death policy, they don't even use
the word death, which is very interesting. It is the 'Inactive
Account Manager'. So we get this idea that we never die online, we
just go inactive. The 'Inactive Account Manager' is not for death
per se, but it deals with inactivity, for example if you are in a
state of health in which you can't deal with your accounts. So, you
are able to determine what you do with all your Google things, such
as Google Wallet, Gmail, Google Drive, and all the other million
things we have there. But if you say you want to delete something,
you are not erased from the server logs. You are supposed to be
able to erase your search history, but actually you can't because
it is saved in the server logs, so in that sense your history is
just somewhere else.</p>

<p>Twitter does not really deal with death (apparently they would
discontinue the account). Basically if you are dead, how would they
find it out and how do they verify it? I am not sure how this
works. There are so many services that will continue your twitter
presence even after you die, so the whole idea of death does not
seem to exist on Twitter.</p>

<p><span class="lk">LK:</span> That is also interesting: how does a
company really know a person is dead? They might just be
inactive.</p>

<p><span class="as">AS:</span> On Facebook that was actually quite
an issue. Because before the legacy contact one had to show proof
that a person is dead, for example with a death certificate. But it
appears that in practice this was not always verified. So it
happened that someone said a person was dead and it was a prank, so
the person's Facebook was de-activated, but the person was still
alive. They then had to prove that they were still alive. So they
got hacked in a way. This raises questions like: How do you prove
that you are still alive, when there are so many modes of presence
through bots and algorithms? What does it mean to be <em>alive</em>
anymore?</p>

<p><span class="lk">LK:</span> So in the end, if we want to erase
our presence from Facebook, dead or alive, it is impossible?</p>

<p><span class="as">AS:</span> I think so, it is absolutely nearly
impossible.</p>

<p><span class="lk">LK:</span> In your work
<em>ne.me.quitte(s).pas</em> USB sticks with data are physically
destroyed by using acid. And in <em>Goodnight Sweetheart</em>
various storage mediums are embalmed in epoxy, totally blocking the
access to the data they contain. What was the process to choose
these strategies of deletion for your artworks?</p>

<p><span class="as">AS:</span> I was thinking of ways to destroy
data so that it could not be accessible anymore. Another more
visceral way than just smashing the hard-drive with a hammer. Then
I met Jonathan Kemp, who was making gold cocktails from old
hardware. You can strip the heavy metals by using a specific mix of
acids called 'aqua regia' (HNO<sub>3</sub>+3 HCl). It is an old
method to make gold soluble. I thought wow, gold cocktails, this is
such a poetic drink. Learning about the process of the acid being
able to dissolve the metal, that's when I thought &ndash; can we
try this with the USB sticks? That is how the whole thing came
about, through collaboration with him.</p>

<p>In the second iteration it became apparent that using the acid
was kind of a cremation of the data. I don't know if you know
someone who has been cremated? When you receive the ashes
afterwards &ndash; it is very strange material thing to receive. It
became clear that the remnants I would send back in the post, were
like remnants from a cremation.</p>

<p>In the second project I thought what if we could embalm the
data, make a relic out of it, in the way people embalm animals or
humans at the funeral before burying them. The choice of the
material came about for practical reasons; what can dry in such a
way, in a certain time, that is transparent and that can have the
embalming features. It ended up with resin for the devices and
epoxy for the USB sticks.</p>

<p><span class="lk">LK:</span> Both of your projects are also
participatory. The data was chosen and given to you by the
participants. Have you collected any statements of how they felt
about the final erasure of the data?</p>

<p><span class="as">AS:</span> I have a little bit, and I must say
that it is rather incidental in the sense that I never intended to
ask people afterwards about the data. It was always supposed to be
an anonymous thing. I never look at the data, I just either embalm
or cremate it and send it back to them. Interestingly I have been
reproached for this, apparently it is my duty to collect metadata
about what I erase, people cannot let go. But I did end up doing
interviews about the project, incidentally with people that had
done it, so I do have those statements. And interestingly enough
most of the people I spoke to had sent data relating to a past
relationship. Not necessarily someone who died, usually a past
boyfriend or girlfriend. So, for example you have old pictures in
your pictures folders and every time you go looking for an image
you might see an old photo of that boyfriend. These people would
say that this gave them the opportunity to organize it in a way, to
decide what to keep and what to delete, or just to erase
everything, to get closure from that relationship. That was the
story I encountered most often.</p>

<p><span class="lk">LK:</span> The biological human memory needs to
forget: How important do you think it is that in the digital realm
there is a right to be forgotten as well? On the other hand when
someone dies we want to remember them by creating monuments; how
does this translate to the digital?</p>

<p><span class="as">AS:</span> That is a tough question. I think it
is very important to be able to forget. Both in the human brain, if
we can make such a separation anymore, and online. To be able to
erase is definitely crucial to the eventual function of our
collective memory. But that is not to say &ndash; erase everything;
rather &ndash; how do we then think about archiving in general?
Archiving is always a power structure, so whoever gets to decide
what we erase, is also the one who has the power to decide such
things. I was thinking recently about how it could be in the
future, that you might have to pay to have things erased. The
people in control of the servers would have the ability to erase
data and it would be a very high-cost service. So the rich people
would be able to delete their data and the poor people would
not.</p>

<p><span class="lk">LK:</span> This is very interesting, because
today one is ready to pay for recovering lost data, so why not pay
for deleting data? It sounds like a very evil business model!</p>

<p><span class="as">AS:</span> It does, but I think it is not such
a far-fetched idea. It started a long time ago, that when we get
free services, all of what we do online is tracked, even when we
pay it is tracked. All this information we give involuntarily to
the company. Now there are services that will specifically ask you
for more personal information, for example tracking your heartbeat,
and then you get the service for free. We are already starting to
see the digital divide between people that have no money at all,
that will just give away whatever information asked to obtain a
service. I can see this building towards the point where there is
all this evidence that can be used against you, as we know, and you
should pay a big price to get it erased.</p>

<p><span class="lk">LK:</span> As a last question, do you think
there can be artistic strategies to deal with this?</p>

<p><span class="as">AS:</span> I think that artists working with
strategies of deletion or erasure are addressing the issues.
Thinking about networked data as part of our selves, and therefore
treating it in a different way, as a material thing with
consequences, that will help us to deal with these issues. Artists
that work with erasure of data emphasize materiality of data, and
this is very relevant. Demystifying the ephemeral cloud network
fallacy will already change how we address these issues.</p>

Technology-based Art and Destruction -- Exhibiting
Malfunctions</h1>

<div class="by">by Stefan Tiefengraber</div>

<p>Easy, uncomplicated interaction with interactive art
installations and an entertaining approach to attract visitors
opens up room to learn the story behind the art. These are the main
goals of my projects and a big part of the two introduced works
<em>User Generated Server Destruction</em><sup><a href="#801d67b8">61</a></sup> and <em>your unerasable
text</em><sup><a href="#02f1b640">62</a></sup>. Both works invite
visitors to destroy something. One time a text message is printed
out and shredded, and the other time it is the destruction of a
server by the force of hammers. The two installations are available
for 24 hours each and can also be operated by users not in the
venue, creating an independence of opening hours. While <em>your
unerasable text</em> is displayed in a shop window (depending on
the exhibition venue), <em>User Generated Server Destruction</em>
can be followed via a webcam, which is part of the installation.
The server is filmed and viewable via stream on a website
specifically created for that purpose.</p>

<p>Both installations are easy to interact with. <em>your
unerasable text</em> is operated by short messages and <em>User
Generated Server Destruction</em> provides three buttons on the
website to push. Behind this surface of fun and interactivity, the
user is invited to question the background of these technologies.
Why do the pieces work this way? What data is generated? Who has
access to it? Where is the data?</p>

<h2 id="user-generated-server-destruction----2013">User Generated
Server Destruction -- 2013</h2>

<p>Visitors of the website www.ugsd.net can trigger six hammers and
drop them onto a server that is located in the exhibition. This
server hosts the website, a single site that shows three buttons to
release the hammers and a video stream to follow what&rsquo;s
happening with the piece. The installation ends, once the server is
destroyed and can therefore no longer host the website.</p>

<p>If you are connected and looking at a website like this, it
seems to appear out of nothing. But there is data -- zeros and ones
compiling an image, text or a video. It is tempting to think there
is no physical connection to any hardware. The physical, sculptural
attendance of the work <em>User Generated Server Destruction</em>
typifies the coincidence of the virtual, the intangible world of
data, and the physical world, where we, the humans, exist. The
installation visualizes very directly that behind the virtuality
that we attribute to the data on the Internet, there actually is
tangible reality and actual physical hardware.</p>

<p>The Internet is a continually growing network of servers spread
all over the world. On the one side are the users and on the other
side the suppliers of the network. Usually, it is only possible for
computer viruses and very qualified users to attack and destroy
highly protected servers that are locked in well secured
places.</p>

<p>These places are data centers, where the big 'Data-Farmers' are
saving all the information we are providing them with. Looking like
factories, these centers have big tube systems to cool all the
computers. They are strategically built near rivers, guaranteeing
enough water for this process. You will always find a power plant
close to it, feeding electricity to computers, which are not only
hungry for data but also for electrical power. Highest standards of
security protect the data from loss by any means. The risk of
losing the data is not to be taken, no matter how important the
data is. One never knows for what or whom it might be useful for
some day.</p>

<p>As users we can control our computers and are able to easily
destroy hard drives. But the data we feed to clouds and websites is
impossible for us to control and erase. Spread over many hard
drives and servers across the world, there is no access for us.
<em>User Generated Server Destruction</em> poses a counterpart to
this. It is something that works in the other direction and hands
the power back to the users, who are all of a sudden in a position
to decide freely what happens to the data. It becomes possible to
erase one of the servers and thereby shrink the worldwide network
for the blink of an eye. What is left is a sculpture created by
destruction, typifying the physical presence of the Internet.</p>

<p>So far, 27 servers in several exhibitions all over the world
have been destroyed. Although employing similar hardware every
time, it took from 2 to 1002 hits for the hammers to finish the
destruction. Some servers stopped working after a short period of
operating and some worked for several days, although being hit
permanently. For some curators this is hard to exhibit, since the
installation can be destroyed at any time, leaving a
non-functioning artwork behind. That creates a fear of disappointed
visitors, not able to participate in the process of destruction.
Given the common notion that an interactive artwork has to function
non-stop, this is difficult.</p>

<p>The concept is to destroy the server and only leave a sculpture
and a video documentation behind, archiving the process. The server
is not supposed to be fake, and there is no intention to make it
more robust than it initially is. This would make the artwork
weaker. Each server receives an individual, ascending number, and
the hits are displayed on the website for every server in one
exhibition. Nevertheless, replacing the server after destruction
makes the piece more interesting for galleries and museums. A
solution for longer exhibitions, like the one in the Ars
Electronica Center in 2013, which lasted around three months, is to
only operate the server during a certain time of a day. The server
will be active 24 hours, but the time of operation is limited.</p>

<p>At the Node festival in 2015, the curators agreed to just show
one server and host a &ldquo;launch event&rdquo; following an
artist talk. This provides the time to generate curiosity and
create attention, as everyone wants to have the first, and maybe
already final, hit on the server. A lot of people waited to finally
hear the sound of the 800 grams heavy sledgehammers smashing the
metal cover of the computer.</p>

<h2 id="your-unerasable-text----201112">your unerasable text --
2011/12</h2>

<p><em>your unerasable text</em> is an interactive installation
dealing with the topics of data storage and elimination. The
installation can be placed in an exhibition, but is ideally
exhibited in a window in public space, where it can be used by
people passing by 24h a day.</p>

<p>The participant is asked to send a text message to the number
written on a sign next to the installation: &ldquo;send your
unerasable text message to +43 664 1788374&rdquo;</p>

<p>The receiving mobile phone transfers the data to a computer,
which layouts the message automatically. It is then printed on to a
DIN A6 paper, falling directly into a paper shredder. There, the
message remains readable for a few moments and is then destroyed.
The shredded paper forms a visible heap of paper on the floor,
growing with every message.</p>

<p><em>your unerasable text</em> works via SMS, as it is the
easiest and most comfortable way for the participant -- and almost
everybody owns a mobile phone. The standard for the short message
service was implemented in the early 1990s and is still used and
integrated in every mobile phone, even in smart phones. Another
advantage is that users don&rsquo;t have to be close to the
installation, messages can be sent from all over the world, and
they don&rsquo;t need any additional software or access to the
Internet to participate.</p>

<p>When <em>your unerasable text</em> is used, the sent text
message isn&rsquo;t erased. The data is passing by the mobile
carrier of the sender and receiver, the mobile that is integrated
in the installation and the computer processing the text and
sending it to the printer. At each of these points the data can be
saved. The installation stores a file of each message consisting of
the sent text, the phone number of the sender, and time and date
when it was sent. The only thing that actually is erased, is the
print, which is just a visualization having no effect on the data
itself.</p>

<p>The storing of data is a rather current topic, given the
discussions on bringing back the
&ldquo;Vorratsdatenspeicherung&rdquo; (data preservation) in
Germany, along with discussions in the Austrian parliament about
passing the &ldquo;Staatsschutzgesetz&rdquo; (state protection law)
including points to bring back the previously overturned
&ldquo;Vorratsdatenspeicherung&rdquo;, under the guise of this new
law.</p>
<!-- % HYPHENATE: Vorratsdatenspeicherung Vorrats-datenspeicherung -->
<!-- % H!YPHENATE: Vorratsdatenspeicherung Vor-rats-daten-spei-che-rung -->

<p>Also very recently, the Safe Harbor law was declared illegal by
the Court of Justice of the European Union, creating the need for
re-negotiation between the EU and the US to change this law.</p>

<p>This also raises questions about the locations of the servers we
are using and the law applied to the data stored on hard-drives all
over the world. There has to be a definition of who legally has
access to our data and is able to pass our information on to third
parties. This is also a significant topic in the installation
<em>User Generated Server Destruction</em>.</p>

<p>As far as exhibitions and other possibilities for exhibiting
these works are concerned, maintenance is a crucial point. Both
installations have a high frequency of usage, 27 servers have
already been shown and destroyed in 10 exhibitions. By November
2015 more then 27.400 short messages were collected.</p>

<h1 id="third-person-data">Third Person Data</h1>

<div class="by">by Dr. Michael Sonntag</div>
<!-- % TEXINJECT: \vspace{-2\baselineskip} -->

<h2 id="what-is-third-person-data">What is &ldquo;Third Person
Data&rdquo;?</h2>
<!-- % SCALEFONT: 1.05 -->

<p>Data about a person may exist at various locations: if we think
about our own personal data, e.g. our preferences in communication
(who we send E-mails to or receive from), interests (what we
&ldquo;like&rdquo; on Facebook) or habits (which websites we visit
regularly), then many persons know about these things. Obviously we
know about ourselves quite a lot (but take care: you might be able
to name your favorite E-Mail contacts, but could you correctly
identify all topical areas you &ldquo;liked&rdquo; in the past?).
Comparatively easy to identify are persons or corporations we gave
the data to directly: our E-Mail provider, the social networking
platform, and the websites we visit regularly. We might not always
like that they know, but this is difficult to avoid and data
protection laws provide not only theoretical but at least partly
also effective limits and remedies against data misuse.</p>

<p>Much more difficult to &ldquo;take care&rdquo; of are third
persons processing our data: not only would you have to know about
their existence and what they actually collect and store, but they
can also be located anywhere and you do not have any contract with
them &ndash; or they would not be third persons. Examples of such
third persons and third person data are:</p>
<!-- % VFILL: -->
<!-- % TEXINJECT: \normalsize -->
<!-- % NEWPAGE: -->

<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Advertisement networks:</strong> They place
advertisements on various websites. Through their own cookies they
track users across all websites where one of their ads is
displayed. Note that the owner&rsquo;s influence is limited to the
advertisement area &ndash; everything else is under direct control
of the advertiser and cannot be hindered or prevented by the site.
If at one place they can identify the person (e.g. through login
and data sharing by the website operator), then all collected data
from all sites can be attributed to this person.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><strong>Intelligence agencies:</strong> Monitoring Internet
lines, especially at the backbone level, allows collecting data on
many users and in detail. Even encryption only partially helps, as
e.g. the IP address (source computer and destination web server,
for instance) cannot be hidden in that way. The only advantage for
users is that the amount of data is so large that only small parts
can be stored for a longer time: complete data is collected only in
case you are individually targeted (for whatever reason).</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><strong>Platform participants:</strong> Platforms like Facebook,
eBay, or Amazon know you, which is obvious. Not immediately
apparent is that many elements on these platforms, e.g. products,
games, or additional services, might be provided by third parties.
While their name is often accessible or even shown, they may
collect significant data on a user&rsquo;s behavior or interests
without clearly appearing as someone else: they look like an
integral part of the platform. Often they can access data other
than that which directly collected in their &ldquo;parts&rdquo;
through the platform, e.g. the user profile or parts thereof.
Typically default privacy configurations allows extensive
access.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><strong>Identity providers:</strong> Logging in through a single
central account may be simple and convenient, but simultaneously
the identity provider can collect a list of when the person has
authenticated where. Additional information may be disclosed too,
e.g. if different verification levels exist or if the site where
authentication is performed provides details like where in the site
authentication is requested, for instance creating a new account,
checking out, or performing specific actions requiring enhanced
verification. These are third parties only in respect to logins;
they may collect additional data directly as well.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><strong>Video surveillance:</strong> Whenever you walk through a
city, you will be recorded by video cameras. These could either be
officially installed and operated e.g. by the police, or be
privately used (but still covering public or semi-public locations
&ndash; e.g. streets or shops). Usually there is no direct
information at all regarding who collects data, storage duration,
who has access to it when, etc. Each camera alone is typically not
very interesting, but if the data of many is combined and becomes
available, the person can be identified (e.g. by facial
recognition, detailed accounts of the locations a person visits
when). Another example for gathering data are automated toll
collection systems and section controls. Most operate by license
plate recognition, which works very reliably on a technical level.
Also, in some countries such systems are built into tow trucks
driving through cities and scanning for cars suitable for
repossession. Naturally most of the license plates scanned will be
useless, but technically there is no problem at all storing this
information in a database, associated with a timestamp and a
geolocation, for future use (building profiles, selling etc).</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><strong>Storage reuse:</strong> Old data media might be securely
erased or destroyed, but very often that is not the case and they
end up on auction websites as &ldquo;used/second hand&rdquo;, or
through shops as &ldquo;refurbished&rdquo;. Sometimes they are
shipped to third-world countries for recycling or disposal. In all
these cases data on the media may remain accessible, because with
modern harddisks, for example, securely erasing the content but
leaving it in working order is complicated and requires a long
time. For other mediums (like SSDs or memory sticks) this may be
even more complicated. Hence the data may end up somewhere else,
although it has officially been destroyed &ndash; it is just that
nobody actually took care of this. While targeted attacks are not
possible, the results can be problematic for those unlucky persons
whose data can be recovered.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><strong>Second persons &ldquo;Plus&rdquo;:</strong> Even those
we do have a contract with or freely give data to might change to
third persons. When data is aggregated with other information (e.g.
statistical data), used for a different purpose or passed on to
someone else, the lines become blurred. Is this still the original
data we gave to them? Who now physically controls it? What are they
going to do with it? What if the recipient of data passes it on
again &ndash; will you ever know who now has your data and what it
will be used for? The end result therefore closely resembles the
situation when a third party collects data itself.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><strong>Data theft:</strong> Hacking systems is not fun anymore
but business. Therefore data stolen from large websites is a
valuable commodity and will be used and resold. Many times this
takes place without the affected persons knowing this fact, as such
hacks/data thefts are denied and kept secret as long as possible:
admitting them would cause bad press, liability and increased
security measures in the future for the company they were entrusted
to.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Third person data can therefore be defined as data about a
person which is stored, collected, or used by someone the person
does not know is doing this (a third person), and where therefore
no direct control or verification/supervision is possible.</p>

<h2 id="implications-for-computer-forensics">Implications for
Computer Forensics</h2>

<p>For computer forensics, which can be roughly defined as the
investigation of digital data in the context of legal proceedings,
third person data can be invaluable, but also very problematic.
Invaluable because this is data collected by someone who is not
involved and therefore trustworthy. The suspect might have deleted
his browser history, but the advertisement network still knows
where he has been when (at least partially). But it can be
problematic as well, because by default (i.e. in most cases) the
investigator does not know who might have such data in her
possession, and if they do, how to obtain access to it.
Additionally there is no guarantee that data exists, that it is
complete, of good quality, reliable etc.</p>
<!-- % VFILL: -->
<!-- % NEWPAGE: -->

<h2 id="how-to-know-data-exists-at-all-and-where">How to know data
exists at all &ndash; and where</h2>

<p>The first and most simple option is just to know who collects
which data. While this is a good approach for experts and in narrow
areas, this obviously cannot be a general solution. Still it should
not be omitted as computer forensics is something only experts
should perform and these might then know potential owners of
additional data. Such knowledge can be obtained or expanded through
investigations. If e-mails are of interest, for example, then the
layperson will see the sender (&ldquo;Sent&rdquo; mailbox) and the
recipient (&ldquo;Inbox&rdquo;) as those possessing data about the
time of sending/receiving the mail. But experts know that
additional header lines (normally not shown!) exist, creating a
trace of servers the mail traversed on its way from source to
destination. And every server appearing in there might (or should,
unless it was not saved or already deleted) have some third person
data referencing this mail and can therefore confirm or refute
certain aspects about it. This means that investigations may
uncover potential holders of additional data usable as
evidence.</p>

<p>Another option to discover third person data is to perform the
same activities as the person suspecting the existence of such
data, but simultaneously and explicitly looking for any signs of
surveillance or even employing tools actively scanning for them.
This is suitable for open video monitoring, for example: normally
we don&rsquo;t notice any cameras, but when we explicitly look for
them, they are easy to see. Hidden (or temporary: see tow truck
example above) cameras are more difficult to catch, but with enough
experience and diligence these might be discovered at least
sometimes. Also wireless connections can be detected easily (but
not necessarily their content), leading to processing devices which
might collect some data (or not). On the Internet this is easier,
as it is trivial to monitor all network traffic of your computer in
detail. When visiting a webpage it is then possible to identify
where the computer connects to, what cookies it sends out and
receives, etc. But passing data on by the server or changes between
the original incident and the investigation (new advertisement
partner) pose significant problems.</p>

<p>If such third parties collecting data have been hacked, their
data might have been published on the Internet. Based on this
information, it can be assumed what these (or similar) parties are
observing. So if you are not part of the data disclosed, some
conclusions can still be drawn. The Snowden disclosure can serve as
an example here. The capabilities of one specific secret service
have been published, but it must be assumed that similar services
in other countries are mostly capable of the same actions.
Additionally, it is possible to identify what someone else with
comparable access might be able to do &ndash; and therefore
probably is doing.</p>

<p>This leads to the next, and rather pessimistic, category: when
someone possesses the technical capabilities to monitor and collect
data, he will. This is not necessarily true, but at least in
countries with weak privacy laws this must be assumed. There data
will be collected just in case and quickly be sold to others, if
they show interest and are willing to pay. So this approach is
better suited to identifying what kind of data might be third party
data than who the third party is.</p>

<p>Definite third party holders of data are all kinds of
&ldquo;upstream providers&rdquo; of services. AirBnB does not own
any servers, for example, instead they use Amazon web services. So
Amazon obviously does have physical access to all of their data.
They might not be allowed to look at it (contract), but they can
access it, e.g. in case of emergencies or on request of third
parties. While direct data access seems unlikely, using the data
for calculating statistics is quite probable. Physical access is
especially interesting if the company gets into financial
difficulties, as Amazon might use their data as security,
preventing any access by them or you, the actual owner, or as
compensation for unpaid invoices (e.g. through selling to someone
else; similar to utilizing domain names in bankruptcy).</p>

<p>The last useful option is inserting incorrect data and waiting
for it to come up somewhere again. For instance an arbitrary e-mail
address might be created and disclosed to a single provider
(creating a new one for each target is not difficult). Whenever
someone contacts you on this address, you know one person to whom
your data (or at least parts of it) was disclosed too &ndash; and
from which source. This is obviously time-consuming and works only
if data usage is observable (e.g. difficult with video
surveillance). Also, &ldquo;storing for future use/reference&rdquo;
cannot be detected in this way.</p>

<p>Finally you could perform illegal actions where the only
evidence is the potentially monitored behavior and wait to be
arrested (which resembles the previous approach). While this method
is very reliable, as the police/prosecutor will have to disclose
how they found you and present the evidence in court at the latest
(hence the behavior must be the only evidence existing at all),
this cannot be recommended. Still it is useful regarding other
persons (e.g. criminals performing illegal activities for other
reasons), as verifying what has been used as evidence in the past
can be assumed as a lower limit of what is possible today.</p>

<p>As an overview, the methods described above are presented here
briefly in a table with some properties: time required to obtain
information, reliability (wrongly assumed to possess data or
incorrectly seen as having no data), completeness (will we find all
such third parties) and associated costs (not necessarily monetary,
but also effort required or &ldquo;drawbacks&rdquo;
experienced).</p>

<h2 id="obtaining-access-to-third-person-data">Obtaining access to
third-person data</h2>

<p>If somebody wants to know what a third person knows about them,
several options exist. However, it must be considered that this
party might possess the data illegally (or exceeding legal
permissions) or are simply not interested in disclosing this fact
(only bad press, but no additional revenue). Therefore replies may
be slow or non-existing. From the computer forensic view, at least
in &ldquo;official&rdquo; cases, e.g. court proceedings, several
additional options do exist. Moreover, cooperation of the data
holder might then be enforceable (at least within a country).</p>

<p>First, the person can request access to her/his own data. This
only works for personal data according to privacy laws, explicitly
granting this right. Outside the EU, someone possessing data
because of a contract is not necessarily required to provide it.
This situation is very problematic with third parties, as they are
usually unwilling to disclose it voluntarily. Also, while the
person might have a contract with company A, and this company a
contract with company B, this does not automatically mean that data
at B must be disclosed to the person. Any court case is between the
person and A, for example, so B is an &ldquo;innocent
bystander&rdquo; and unaffected by these proceedings. Only A might
be ordered to rely on some contract provisions it has with B to
first obtain data and secondly disclose it. This requires the
person to at least conclusively demonstrate that such data probably
does exist and would help the case. Even then, especially in civil
proceedings, access might be difficult, as B could argue that this
would adversely impact trade secrets. Only in case of criminal
proceedings is such transitive disclosure easier, because the
police can also search/impound data located at third parties (after
obtaining appropriate permissions, typically from a judge).</p>

<p>Indirectly this third person data might be obtained through
information from the second party: what is stored there could have
been passed on to third parties, and, if logs are available, the
actual transfers might be reconstructed as well. While this seems
to establish an &ldquo;upper limit&rdquo; (at most these items
could have been transferred), that is not the case. The third party
may have obtained separate additional data from other sources,
combined it with such other information, or enriched it with
previously anonymous data. So in reality, more or more detailed
information may exist with the third party. Still this approach
serves as a first approximation.</p>

<p>An illegal method to obtain access is hacking the data
custodian. This could be the actual owner or someone else, e.g. a
cloud provider, with physical access. While this is obviously
illegal, in case of sufficient knowledge/resources, it is a quite
promising method. Advantageous is that no owner consent is required
and that internationality is not a problem but rather a boon.
However, hacking is typically not that easy and there is no
guarantee of success. Often only a webserver can be compromised and
other servers, where third-party data might be expected, are more
difficult to reach.</p>

<p>As third-party data is only rarely collected for the purpose of
merely owning it, but rather for deriving monetary benefits,
offering to buy it is another chance for retrieval. It might be
necessary to pose as someone else (typically a company intending to
use the data), as well as to obtain a larger part of the dataset
(e.g. all Austrian users). This may obviously be costly and/or
illegal, especially if data of other persons must be acquired too
or false statements (&ldquo;I am a company&rdquo;) are
involved.</p>

<h2 id="problems-of-third-person-data">Problems of third-person
data</h2>

<p>While the person the data is about typically desires access to
it and simultaneously wants to keep it secret (i.e. the owner of
the data should not be allowed to use it or pass it on further),
this is not necessarily the case. Sometimes the owner would be
interested in publishing the data, e.g. to be able to provide an
alibi. This may contradict interests of the third party: data is
only valuable if it is not generally available, and more so when
its legality is questionable. But even if the person obtains the
data, owners might retain some rights to it, especially if the
original data (collected or received) has been enhanced or combined
with data collected by them. This is comparable to the problem of
credit-worthiness checks: while data access is granted (and the
person could then publish it), the algorithm for calculating the
score remains secret and need not be disclosed. Additional persons
might be involved too, such as telephone call records, which can
create further difficulties: any party might obtain access, but
publication must consider rights of other communication
participants too.</p>

<p>While third person data can be difficult to access legally for
the persons affected, this is not equally true for data owners
&ndash; collecting or buying it is legal in many jurisdictions.
Even then &ndash; and more so when ownership is not perfectly legal
&ndash; such data is typically kept &ldquo;secret&rdquo;. So
knowing about it becomes difficult, reducing the acceptance of such
data by the persons affected. However, this effect should not be
overestimated. Considering the existing public registers of
applications using/storing personal data (mandatory within the EU),
little effect on the general population is observable, which rarely
even knows of their existence. From this it can be concluded that
public registers or general availability of data categories stored
by someone are unlikely to significantly improve the situation. And
individual rights to retrieve such information would be enough for
e.g. investigative journalists.</p>

<p>Legally, third person data is difficult to regulate: by
definition there exists no direct contact or contract between data
subject and data owner. Therefore all rights of both parties depend
either on the law or a chain of contracts, which might be
enforceable by third parties &ndash; or not (legally possible, but
restricted in scope and difficult in practice). Combined with the
typical internationality of electronic data this further
complicates matters, as normal contracts are much easier to enforce
across borders than such contract chains. Also, national laws
obviously differ and then the only hope are the EU or international
treaties: harmonized rules applying to many countries. The problem
of international relations in personal data was recently tackled by
the ECJ, who ruled that &ldquo;Safe Harbor&rdquo; provisions
allowing the export of personal data to the USA are invalid.
Another example is that the collection and export of personal data
might be illegal in the &ldquo;source&rdquo; country, but gathering
and importing it can be perfectly legal in the
&ldquo;destination&rdquo; country. While in &ldquo;real&rdquo; life
such trans-border situations are hardly applicable (using a
telescope to watch persons across borders), this is the typical
situation on the Internet.</p>

<p>Another issue of third person data is correctness: how does
someone (i.e. the person it is attributed to, but similarly the
third party itself) know, whether data is correct or not? It could
lack important details, contain old values now invalid, or include
calculated data which was correct enough for the original purpose
but is not for the new one. Also, third person data might just be
invented. An example for the latter are fake profiles identified in
the Ashley-Madison website hack. While it is unlikely that
names/e-mail addresses of real persons have been used, e.g. for
pictures or other data, often actual profiles are harvested from
other dating websites or scraped from social media platforms.
Re-identification could therefore lead to real persons, for whom it
can be difficult to explain that it was not them using a fake name
and an anonymous e-mail account. Verification of third person data
is complicated by the fact that it was not obtained from the
persons directly, so modifications or additions might have been
introduced at any intermediary point the data passed through
&ndash; typically without information where exactly. Another source
for incorrectness or inconsistencies is that such data is often
collected solely indirectly (i.e. not through asking the person but
observing and drawing conclusions). For instance devices might be
shared (especially common with PCs and tablets, which the whole
family might use; less so mobile phones), but any data collected
through it is attributed to the &ldquo;one and only&rdquo; owner.
For instance, when a father allows his children to use his tablet
they might contact their friends, e.g. through chats, visiting
social media profiles, posting messages and so on. Therefore
obviously this adult male is strangely interested in small
children, contacts them, and must be a pedophile in the eyes of
someone observing data only indirectly, e.g. through trackers in
advertisements. Such danger is much higher for third-parties, as
they typically do not interact directly with the person they are
collecting data about and therefore have few chances for noticing a
different user, for instance, as in the example.</p>

<p>When considering the difficulties of deleting e.g. revenge porn
or any other data from the Internet, it becomes clear, that the
existence of third person data is problematic. This is exemplified
by the possibility of &ldquo;removing&rdquo; data from Google
search results. The data itself remains on the Internet, is still
indexed, will continue to show up in search results etc &ndash;
only searches for &ldquo;name&rdquo; or &ldquo;name + topic&rdquo;
will not contain this specific link (searches for
&ldquo;topic&rdquo; will!). In relation to Google this is again
third person data, and while rendering it a bit more difficult to
find is commendable, this cannot be considered a real solution.
Either the data needs to (or may) remain publicly accessible, or it
should be deleted. Otherwise we create classes of people: those who
possess the tools or the knowledge to find things, and the
&ldquo;dumb masses&rdquo; who do not. The latter will then have no
control over their own data and not be able to find it, while the
&ldquo;privileged&rdquo; can access all data (their own and
others), therefore creating an artificial distinction and partial
immunity, as they can hide their misdeeds, while others cannot.</p>

<h2 id="outlook">Outlook</h2>

<p>Third person data will increase in the future, as much more data
is being collected and will be retained. And what is stored will be
used and transferred on to maximize profit. Especially problematic
in this context is the &ldquo;Internet of Things&rdquo;, where many
small devices are equipped with computing power and communication
possibilities. Here easily even the vendor could become a third
party &ndash; no permanent contract is really needed for a coffee
machine, but &ldquo;outsourcing the evaluation of the data to the
cloud for better brewing of coffee&rdquo; is going to be a reality:
see for instance Nest thermostats, which send a lot of information
to the cloud in the hope of slightly improving comfort or reducing
heating costs (where energy savings might be offset by the
additional energy required for communication and cloud servers!).
Who exactly receives this data and what is or will be done with it
later remains unclear. Regarding future developments, similar
considerations apply to cars (mandatory eCall: an automatic
telephone call is placed to an emergency number in case of a crash;
a continuous mobile phone connection is optional for this
application, but added-value services are envisaged &ndash; then a
third party, the mobile phone operator, will be able to
continuously locate any car, at least if in use), or fitness
trackers (e.g. sending data to health insurance companies for lower
payments).</p>

<p>What options exist to improve the situation or reduce problems?
Some approaches could be:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Transparency:</strong> Publication of who possesses
which data, perhaps with automated abilities to check whether you
are included. Based on past experience, only few people would
actually use such a system. On the other hand it is complicated and
expensive to set up and could easily open up security holes,
allowing other persons access to such data (effectively spreading
data out even more!).</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><strong>Legal regulations:</strong> Restricting third party data
and allowing it only in specific exceptional cases or when
obtaining the data from the person directly (i.e. only direct data
but no third party data). This seems unlikely and difficult to
monitor, but should not be ruled out completely. Most business
models on the Internet depend on directly collecting data and then
&ldquo;selling&rdquo; it. While actually selling it would become
difficult, limited, or forbidden, this would still allow
&ldquo;renting&rdquo; it through placing targeted advertisements on
the same site. Aggregation with data from other sites or
independent sources, however, would be problematic.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><strong>Restricted disclosure:</strong> Probably the most
effective solution is to restrict the amount of data passed on to
others. As soon as someone else knows it, restricting its further
distribution is becoming ever more difficult through
internationality, electronic communication, and data sharing.
Therefore everyone should carefully select whom to disclose what
data to. Is the person trustworthy? What will she do with the data?
Whom will she pass it on to? As a supplement, gathering data should
be regulated more tightly, as secretly gathering data reduces such
&ldquo;data autonomy&rdquo;. Verification is difficult, but as soon
as someone knows about the existence of data, the onus would be on
the data owner to prove direct collection instead of receiving it
from someone else.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><strong>Extended deletion rights:</strong> Whenever someone
controls data which is not explicitly allowed by law (e.g. public
registers) or a contract, the affected person could have an
unequivocal right of deletion, independent of the interests of the
data owner. So whenever the existence of data becomes public,
everyone could request deletion of their data &ndash; regardless of
whether it was acquired legally or not. This would, however,
require effective supervision to ensure such deletion actually
takes place. Closely related would be mandatory &ldquo;data
decay&rdquo;, i.e. mandatory deletion after some time has elapsed,
unless the data has been &ldquo;re-acquired&rdquo; in the
meantime.</p>

Behind the Smart World ArtLab -- artistic strategies for dealing
with resurfacing data</h1>

<div class="by">by KairUs - Linda Kronman and Andreas

<blockquote>
<p>Breaches of Western information security thanks to a rise in
electronic waste circulation have been particularly pronounced in
Ghana, where a certain cadre of citizens has taken to searching out
information on Westerners&rsquo; old hard drives for extortive 
<!-- %> purposes.[@warner:2011:cybercrime]  -->
 purposes.<sup><a href="#c9a8a00e">63</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Since 2010 we as KairUs artist duo have focused on researching
topics such as spam, scam and Internet fraud. In August 2014 our
research had evolved to the stage that we needed to take a field
trip to West Africa, where a considerable number of so called
advance fee fraud originates. Rather than hunting down scammers in
Internet caf&eacute;s, we were interested to see which
technological affordances or limitations the scammers were faced
with in this part of the world. In our initial research we came
across reports about an electronic waste dump called Agbogbloshie.
In the middle of Ghana&rsquo;s capital Accra, in this toxic
wasteland by a lagoon, is where our electronics from developed
countries are illegally dumped. Jennifer Garbys examines in her
book <em>Digital Rubbish</em><sup><a href="#45196e0c">64</a></sup>
in detail how electronic waste ends up at e-waste dumps such as
Agbogbloshie; first they linger in storage, from there high-grade
machines might be resold, the dysfunctional machines are then
shipped in containers to harbors in developing countries such as
the one in Tema, where most of the e-waste enters Ghana. In Tema
the containers are sold and transported to Agbogbloshie. The next
step is the salvaging of components, copper, gold, iron, plastic,
and anything else of value.</p>

<p>Electronics are made of minerals and chemicals, natural
resources that are gleaned by organic laboring bodies, no matter
whether this takes place at an e-waste dump or in a mine. One of
the most memorable sounds from Agbogbloshie was the clacking sound
of metal scrap hitting the aluminum structures of a computer, when
the workers were disassembling the computers into mother boards,
processors and hard drives and further for extraction of valuable
metals and raw earth minerals. Components and materials salvaged at
Agbogbloshie enter new cycles of production, reentering the
consumption cycle, whereas the residues remain. Moore&rsquo;s Law,
a near golden law within the world of computing, predicted the
computer revolution in which the rate of innovation within
electronics has decreased to as little as 18 months.<sup><a href="#95d46dba">65</a></sup> Creating something new will thus be
followed by an another gadget turning old. These old electronics,
dead media, or zombie media, as Jussi Parikka, names them leave
fossilized traces of designed obsolescence and
gadget-culture.<sup><a href="#92d2d5c7">66</a></sup> At
Agbogbloshie these materials are difficult to recycle; the toxic,
unstable materials mix with the black ashes of burned cables and
pieces of electronic fossils. They pile in indefinitely growing
layers of obsolete technologies, if not directly washed through the
lagoon into the sea, as we witnessed during a day of heavy rain.
This is how: <em>&ldquo;dead media creeps back as dangerous toxins
into the soil or then as zombie media recycled into new
assemblies&rdquo;</em><sup><a href="#73b4d354">67</a></sup>.
Agbogbloshie, our electronic dystopia earned its nickname - Sodom
and Gomorrah.</p>
<!-- % TEXINJECT: \scalefont{.99} -->

<p>Among other components, <em>&ldquo;zombie&rdquo;</em> hard
drives also enter a new chain of value available at Agbogbloshie in
stock for a negotiated price. Likewise the data saved on these
storage media resurface, even if they were dumped in the trash,
both physically and metaphorically, in the bin on our computer
desktop with an expectation of permanent deletion. What took us to
Agbogbloshie in the first place were reports we read on how
journalism students had discovered data breaches of companies and
governments when recovering data from hard drives bought at the
e-waste dump.<sup><a href="#99abeda8">68</a></sup> Additionally we
found articles describing how scammers abused data originating from
hard drives collected at e-waste dumps in West Africa.<sup><a href="#e7a30f75">69</a></sup> Therefore, when visiting Agbogbloshie we
decided to buy twenty-two hard drives, curious to see whether
dumped data would persist, and could it easily be recovered and
would it be of potential value? Could the data be artistically
reused and/or rather easily abused?</p>
<!-- % RESETFONT: -->

<p>When we returned to Linz our plan was to follow media theorist
Jussi Parikka's suggestion:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In the age of consumer electronics, the artist can also be
thought of as an archaeological circuit bender and hacker, which
links media archeology with the political agenda of contemporary
media production.<sup><a href="#b2ab7822">70</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Our plan was therefore to recover the data from the hard drives
and offer the data and the hard drives as source material for
artistic production. During two DIY-data recovery sessions we
accessed data from three hard drives, just by plugging them in to a
computer. This means that the data on the hard drives was not even
deleted. Two hard drives were recovered by trying out open source
tools such as PhotoRec, TestDisc and Partition Magic. In these
cases the data was deleted by the owner, by trashing it into the
&ldquo;bin&rdquo; or using the delete command. We learned that
deleting data is a rather symbolic gesture, whereas the data is not
actually deleted until it is overwritten. According to data
specialists, even overwritten data can be recovered with special
tools<sup><a href="#26b7c8b3">71</a></sup> and the only hundred
percent secure way to delete data is to physically destroy the
plate where the data is stored. This was demonstrated in one of the
&ldquo;stranger episodes in the history of digital-age
journalism&rdquo;, when the Guardian had to destroy all their hard
drive copies of NSA files leaked by Edward Snowden.<sup><a href="#d5c2f21d">72</a></sup> What made the episode strange was that
British authorities supervising the erasure of the data as well as
the journalist were all aware of existing copies in America and
Brazil, proving that the strength of digital data to persist is in
the easiness of duplicating it.</p>

<p>Of our twenty-two hard drives, seventeen were physically
damaged. In this case such parts as the internal read write heads
or the spindle motor can be changed and the data can still be
recovered. The complicated part is to get the spare parts, as each
brand and model use customized parts, which can still vary
depending on the manufacturing country. Therefore we asked for help
from the company ECS-solutions that recovers lost data as a
business model. Even with their help only one additional hard drive
was recovered. This was mainly because the hard drives where
relatively old, with production dates ranging from 1997-2008, and
spare parts were not easily available.</p>

<p>With 85 GB (229.446 items) of recovered data from six hard
drives we approached nine European artists with various artistic
practices, inviting them to use the data and the hard drives as a
source for creating artworks. In May 2015 we met for an extended
weekend to discuss ideas and our approaches to the recovered data
during the &ldquo;Behind the Smart World&rdquo; ArtLab.
Considerations raised during the ArtLab led to discussions about
ownership of data, how to deal with abstraction of data, how to
avoid exposing private individuals without their consent, and the
labor of structuring data that mostly consisted of
&ldquo;junk&rdquo; such as porn, system files, and images
downloaded while shopping online. Browsing through the recovered
hard drives, it became rather obvious that as a consequence of
seemingly unlimited data storage, we hoard rather than collect
data. Rather fast it became a laborious task to get an overview of
what just a couple of hard drives contain, specially when recovered
data lack both filenames and structure.</p>

<p>During the weekend we also invited experts in data recovery,
data forensics, and data policies to support us in developing
strategies to deal with the data. Additionally, a visit to a
recycling center gave us to better understanding of the material
aspects of electronic waste.</p>

<p>As an outcome of the ArtLab we developed strategies for dealing
with the data, which developed into concepts and further to
artworks for an exhibition. There were two main approaches that
emerged from the ArtLab, one of them focusing on the recovered data
and the other exploring the material aspects of the physical hard
drives. We became aware early on that using data from a hard drive
as found footage needed a different approach than photographs, film
or video cassettes found in a box at a flea-market. Our data
forensics expert Dr. Michael Sonntag suggested that we should mix
data to avoid accidentally exposing a person&rsquo;s identity.
Another approach was to transform the data, mapping it to another
format, which is the case with Joakim Blattmann&rsquo;s artwork, in
which metadata and folder structures from the hard drives are
mapped to a musical score for a classical piano. Metadata can
expose surprisingly private information and folder structures are
like personal memory paths. As a soundscape certain patterns can
still be revealed, while by abstracting the source we avoid
exposing any private data.</p>

<p>Fabian K&uuml;hfuss&rsquo;s work <em>Shopimation</em> examines
how rather impersonal images downloaded in our browser cache during
online shopping can bring us closer to an unknown individual and
his or her &ldquo;aesthetic dreams&rdquo;. <em>Shopimation</em>
uses thumbnails to build up a subjective code of an aesthetic,
thereby translating the very private dream of who the owner of the
hard drive would like to be. This work echoes the economic
ecologies of our commodified Internet experiences, in which our
profiles, interests and desires are continuously tracked and used
to accelerate our consumption.</p>

<p>Em&ouml;ke Bada's <em>Virus Chart</em>, on the other hand, looks
at the trackers, the malware and viruses &ndash; the unwanted
intruders on our hard drives. As the artist explains in an
e-mail:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Before even starting to look at any of the files, I followed the
standard procedure of running a virus scan. Which was interesting
because at the end of the day, on the harddrives that have been
recovered so far, there were 881 viruses all in all.**<sup><a href="#f5260b39">73</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Earlier viruses and malware were often destructive, even causing
physical damage to the host, while today&rsquo;s digital parasites
hoard data and are most successful as long as they are not
recognized. The <em>Virus Chart</em> takes a close look on the
&ldquo;health&rdquo; of these hard drives using medical charts as a
metaphor to describe their maleficent content. Could it also be
that the &ldquo;poor health&rdquo; of the hard drives was the
reason why they ended up at Agbogbloshie in the first place?</p>

<p>In a trilogy of installations, we as the artist duo KairUs
returned to our initial research questions of what is the value of
the data on a hard drive and how could it potentially be (ab)used?
We know that dealing with data is a rather lucrative business
today, yet as we learned from our data policies expert Fieke
Jansen, the data of one person is worth only 0.7-0.01USD (a
speculative estimate made by dividing Google&rsquo;s value by its
users). In these terms data points are only valuable when connected
to others, revealing patterns and desires. Selling the content of a
hard drive to data brokers is worth less than selling its spare
parts to a company in the data recovery business. What can make a
hard drive valuable, on the other hand, is sensitive personal data
that can be abused, including access to banking or shopping
accounts, private images for blackmailing and harassment, or
identity theft. This was the case with U.S. Congressman Robert
Wexler. He was contacted and blackmailed with information from one
of his discarded hard drives that was found in a second-hand
computer market in Ghana.<sup><a href="#e7a30f75">74</a></sup> By
using DIY-data forensic methods combined with open source
intelligent strategies and tools, it was also possible for us to
confirm one of the owners of a hard drive with sensitive images.
And another hard drive shows evidence of being used for romance
scams. The potential abusing of data is therefore the focal point
of these works, illustrating a number of &ldquo;worst case
scenarios&rdquo; based on the recovered data. Even if there is
nothing to hide, your deleted data might still return to haunt
you.</p>

<p>Shifting to the works that deal with the material aspects of the
hard drives, Michael Wirthig&rsquo;s <em>Inside Data (The
Forgotten)</em> focuses on the drive platter as the actual physical
container of our data on a hard drive. This experimental film
travels through the inner parts of a hard drive in extreme
close-ups, using light field microscope images to give the viewer
an intimate perspective of the rather impersonal metal plate.
Scratches and dust are made visible, the most common physical
damage to our hard drives and most often the reason for these
devices to fail. As it was impossible to recover the data from the
majority of the hard drives brought back from Ghana, this work
investigates the most fragile parts of digital data storage.</p>

<p>From a forensic perspective, which rests on individualization,
each hard drive is unique. When zooming in enough with a magnetic
force microscope, even <em>&ldquo;individual bit representations
deposit discreet legible trails&rdquo;</em><sup><a href="#1293ed5b">75</a></sup>, forcing us to review our perspective on
the illusion of an immaterial bit just as a symbol either as a 1 or
a 0. Also Simon Krenn&rsquo;s and Mathias Urban&rsquo;s work
<em>Transposon</em> deals with the material aspects of data and
storage media. During the ArtLab the artists collected magnetic
field recordings from the hard drives, and when the sounds were
amplified the experiment revealed that each hard drive has a unique
sound. In the <em>Transposon</em> sound installation, the sounds
are further recorded to wax cylinders via a modified Edison GEM
phonograph, the earliest commercial medium to record and reproduce
sound. The recordings are in this way reversely migrated from one
&ldquo;zombie medium&rdquo; to another and further back to be mixed
and listened to again in a digital format. Each migration brings
further qualities to the sound, which is transformed along with the
migration processes. Likewise, when any data is migrated, even in
the case of digital files loss, corruption and glitches appear.
These obsolete media with about a decade of age difference are the
black boxes we as artists are called on to hack, bend and
re-purpose, in order to critically reflect on our current
relationship to electronics, their life cycles and residues. The
twenty-two hard drives brought back from Agbogbloshie functioned as
vehicle to discuss data privacy, data collection, data forensics,
e-waste, erasure of data, and dead media. Behind the shiny smart
world of advertisers, another reality is revealed, unfolding the
consequences of our datafied consumer culture, which is far from
being sustainable or fair.</p>

<p><span class="az">AZ:</span> In your practice based research
project <em>DEL? No, wait!REW</em> you contextualize the process of
data recovery in a forensic approach to a collection of discarded
hard drives. In the installation, the audience is asked to either
delete a recovered file or to publish it online. Can you tell a
little bit more about this work? Where did you get the hard drives
from? Can you describe the installation setup?</p>

<p><span class="ml">ML:</span> The installation <em>DELETE?No,
wait!REWIND</em> aims to explore the notion of
&ldquo;deletion&rdquo;, confronting the audience with larger
questions of how to secure deletion of data from a magnetic medium,
data ownership and the ethics of data recovery.</p>

<p>The installation setup consists of three core elements: display
screens showing the graphical user interface (GUI); a tangible
physical interface, or controller; and a spatial element &ndash; a
lit table top, which acts as one of two light sources. A spinning
hard drive is connected to Display Screen No. 1, which shows the
data recovery process in real time using open source software
(testdisk). A cold steel controller reminiscent of an industrial
machine is placed at the center. The controller has two buttons:
Delete and Save. Delete provides the option to permanently remove a
file from the system; Save uploads the file online. Display Screen
No. 2 highlights a custom written software, which facilitates user
interaction by communicating with the controller. Once the save
option is chosen, the retrieved file is saved on a remote server
and published in an online gallery. Saved files are projected on
Display Screen No. 3. The physicality of the hard drives, the
source of the data recovery procedure, is present in the exhibition
space.</p>

<p><span class="az">AZ:</span> Were there any reactions from the
audience? If so, what kind of feedback did you receive?</p>

<p><span class="ml">ML:</span> People are sensitive about their
personal data, but they lack technological knowledge about the
structuring, storing and deletion of their electronic data. Often
the viewers associate themselves with the actual owner(s) of the
hard drives, who remain unknown. In that sense the installation
achieved a greater awareness, which in some cases makes
participants rethink the fallibility of technology and what happens
when they trash their hard drives or files into their digital
recycle bins.</p>

<p><span class="az">AZ:</span> Your work calls the ownership of the
data into question. It raises questions like: Who actually owns
that data? Is the creator, the audience, or are you the owner of
the data? How do you reflect on these questions?</p>

<p><span class="ml">ML:</span> The notion of ownership is polemic.
The work is highly confrontational. It creates a moral dilemma. On
one hand I became the owner by purchasing a collection of hard
drives with a legal transaction. So the physical carrier and the
accompanying content become mine in a sense. Then I am passing my
ethical question(s) to the audience by given them a temporary
ownership or control over the content. However, this is illusionary
due to the fact that the recovered files have already been copied
to software, and even when the delete button is pressed and the
data has been deleted from that software, it still continues to
exist on the magnetic disk, which is present in the exhibition
space. Because of the slippery nature of the digital information, I
think that the notion of ownership is blended out. In other words
there are multiple owners of the same content.</p>

<p><span class="az">AZ:</span> In your work <em>Estimated Time to
Recovery</em> you created an automatized system, which recovers and
deletes files without the consent or the knowledge of the previous
owners. What were the ideas you wanted to bring forth with this
work? Can you reflect on the development phrase of the work and how
you came up with the automatized installation format?</p>

<p><span class="ml">ML:</span> The work proposes an insight to
processes which often remain hidden and run in the background on
our machines, <em>Estimated Time to Recovery</em> is an automatized
system or a feedback loop of recovery and deletion as an attempt to
display these processes, over which the users have no direct
control. The installation consists of a metal box, which contains a
mini computer Raspberry pi running open source software, which
recovers and deletes data from a hard disk. The displayed numbers
show the estimated time to recovery until the process is completed,
and a screen, connected to the pi, shows recovered images in a
random order. When the procedure is finished the machine starts the
reverse process of erasing the recovered data. The choice to
enclose all the hardware in a box is a metaphor of the black box of
our general understanding of the machines.</p>

<p><span class="az">AZ:</span> If files are deleted and recovered
over and over again, could you observe whether this affects the
recovery or deletion? Do the images alter through the process, e.g.
become glitchy or un-recoverable?</p>

<p><span class="ml">ML:</span> <em>&ldquo;Deleted file information
is like a fossil &ndash; its skeleton may be missing a bone here or
there, but the fossil remains, unchanged, until it is completely
overwritten.&rdquo;</em>A beautiful quote from Dan Farmer and
Wietse Venema, <em>Forensic-Discovery</em> serves for the
purpose.</p>

<p>When images are restored they often inherit a sign of the
recovery process &ndash; a distortion of the file, a glitch or an
artifact which is present. While performing the recovery process
over and over again, I was also prompted to identify corrupted
files without any metadata, which could be assigned as
&ldquo;un-recovered&rdquo;. Their content was blank. This also
caused some technical issues with my installation, so I decided to
deliberately avoid them.</p>

<p><span class="az">AZ:</span> In the first installation you give
the visitor a choice to delete or recover data, whereas in the
second work the deletion and recovery process is automatized. Can
you reflect on how this human interaction or lack of interaction
changes the interpretation of the recovery and deletion
processes?</p>

<p><span class="ml">ML:</span> In the first work <em>DEL?No,
wait!REW</em> installation, the viewer becomes an active
participant, to whom a certain choice has been given, but this
choice is still very much determined by an algorithm. In my second
work <em>Estimated time to recovery</em>, on the other hand, the
visitor becomes merely a witness of the process with no possibility
for interaction. I think both of these roles resonate in our
current media realm.</p>

<p><span class="az">AZ:</span> Another of your works is called
<em>Cold Storage</em> and consists of enlarged transparent prints
and five glass cubes that display the circuit boards. Can you tell
a bit more about the work? Can you describe your research for the
work and describe your aesthetic choices?</p>

<p><span class="ml">ML:</span> The <em>Cold Storage</em>
installation was made in the context of the group show entitled
&ldquo;What remains &ndash; Strategies of Saving and
Deleting&rdquo; at esc (medien kunst labor) in Graz. Together with
four other artists I was invited to explore themes of storage,
data, reliability, and the loss of materiality and values. I
started my research by looking at digital forensics and data
erasure as main themes. However, the direction of my research
shifted towards an investigation into data storage, macro chips,
circuit boards, integrated circuit (IC) diodes, and the process of
zooming into their macro structures. Eventually that was reflected
in the final work and its aesthetics choices.</p>

<p>The installation consisted of enlarged transparent prints
containing macro photos of the most common memory devices (USB
stick, SD memory card and PC hard drive) which were placed in the
windows of esc, inviting the passers-by to glimpse inside
&ldquo;What remains&rdquo;. Five glass cubes displaying the circuit
boards (used for the photographs) were lit by a light box. The
glass created an illusionary effect, which makes the hardware to
disappear. Text labels (extracts from data-sheets) are attached to
each cube, informing the viewer of what they are looking at.</p>

<p>The idea behind <em>Cold Storage</em> was to investigate the
architectural dimensions of our storage devices and how they are
translated into the physical world. While digital storage becomes
increasingly disembodied and dematerialized, hardware becomes more
and more invisible, microprocessors and components become smaller
and smaller, and chips are designed to be uncrackable. The work
proposes a poetic overview of the material quality of memory,
asking what is the future of digital storage? Is it <em>&ldquo;a
glass cold memory which lasts forever&rdquo;</em>or an imperfect
storage technology that can impart its contents?</p>

<p><span class="az">AZ:</span> So far in your works the owner is
always separated and distant from the data rather than involved in
a participatory act. Is this a direction you plan to continue or
what are your upcoming steps in your research?</p>

<p><span class="ml">ML:</span> In most of the cases is quite
difficult to trace back the original owner(s). But even then I am
not interested in personifying that data, which might center my
works around the relationship with the actual owner. Instead, I try
to keep it open for different interpretations. My next step is
producing a small publication, based on my research and the
collection of thoughts and images I have gathered.</p>

<p><span class="az">AZ:</span> So based on your research and your
artworks, did this process make you more sensitive about how you
handle data, or how do you deal with your data both on- and off
line?</p>

<p><span class="ml">ML:</span> I learned a lot throughout the
research and the process, but there are still many technical
aspects, which I do not fully understand. I am sensitive about my
data, but I am also not super cautious about it. Otherwise I would
have to become a monk. With this body of work I also attempt to
showcase and discuss freely themes that interest me and might be of
interest to others.</p>

Strategies of Net-activists Against Phishing and Fake Business
Websites</h1>

<div class="by">by KairUs - Linda Kronman and Andreas
Zingerle</div>

<p>This essay is part of our artistic research into vigilante
online communities and Internet fraud. Online communities of so
called scambaiters try to identify, block and report Internet crime
activities. For this they have developed various strategies,
ranging from creating warning platforms to collecting fake checks
or blocking bank accounts, and they organize themselves in
different forums.<sup><a href="#237622f9">76</a></sup> One of these
subgroups call themselves &ldquo;Artists against 419&rdquo; and
host the biggest open-access database of fake websites. As of
November 2015, there are over 4800 registered users and on average
about 35 websites are added to the database each day. They use
&ldquo;passive reconnaissance&rdquo; and &ldquo;open source
intelligence&rdquo; (osint) tools to gather information, so that
they can file reports to the hosting provider to get the websites
taken off the web. Since 2007, the group members have discontinued
using web programs such as &ldquo;Lad Vampire&rdquo; or
&ldquo;Muguito&rdquo; to run &ldquo;Denial of Service&rdquo;
attacks against the websites<sup><a href="#410e2b7a">77</a></sup>
and instead use online tools and written reports to maintain good
relations with hosting providers and law enforcement<sup><a href="#5e945767">78</a></sup>. In the following paragraphs we want to
present one of their work-flow strategies to track and report fake
websites.</p>

<p>Scambaiters use various vernacular tools and social engineering
techniques in order to run background checks on suspicious business
websites. Open source intelligence (osint) refers to intelligence
that has been derived from publicly available sources both on- and
offline. These tools are used in &ldquo;ethical passive
reconnaissance<sup><a href="#12203ae0">79</a></sup>&rdquo; to
gather as much information about the target as possible. In this
version, passive reconnaissance is perpetrated by activists and
hacktivists who are trying to gain information that will support
their political causes or other such ethical motivations. Law
enforcement officials may also use passive reconnaissance as part
of a criminal investigation. Ethical or not, passive reconnaissance
is always done without the authorization of the person or
organization that is being targeted.<sup><a href="#36a8dbcf">80</a></sup></p>

<p>This leads to an effective combination of classical social
engineering attacks on the target, which in turn can be used to
harvest more information. The following chapter summarizes the
hands-on part of a workshop called &ldquo;Credible fictions &ndash;
Deceptive realities&rdquo;<sup><a href="#b09475f2">81</a></sup>. In
the workshop the <em>Megacorp.</em> installation served as a point
of departure to further investigate Internet activism, resurfacing
fake websites and osint tools. The online tools were presented to
the group of participants, who gathered and discussed information
using the collaborative writing tool &ldquo;piratepad&rdquo;.</p>

<p>As an example website we want to focus on www.start-office.biz.
According to their website, start-office.biz is an international
company specializing in organizing virtual offices. They are
located at the Wienerberg Twin Towers in Vienna, Austria, and
currently offer jobs to local agents who should &ldquo;provide
relevant information online for direct clients and other relevant
stakeholders through through popular social networking
sites&rdquo;. In the following paragraphs, we will use the osint
tools to analyze the website and raise suspicion about the
legitimacy of the website.</p>

<h2 id="look-and-feel">Look and Feel</h2>

<p>Every website is designed differently. Over the years certain
trends in usability set standards for web designers. You can always
ask yourself, how coherent is the web design? Does a photo with the
company logo have a pixelated, poor quality, whereas all other
photos are crisp and sharp? Does the logo look badly manipulated
into an image?</p>

<p>On the front page of our example website we see the dark black
logo of start-office.biz. Font type and size of the logo look
misplaced and don&rsquo;t fit the overall dominant gray and dark
blue color combination. In one of the header images the logo is
clearly squeezed in the image. The company&rsquo;s headquarter is
supposedly located in Vienna, Austria. The website claims to
operate on a global scale and runs hundreds of offices in the USA
and Canada. The page language is English and there is no
translation to German available. On the &ldquo;testimonials&rdquo;
page we find a review from a person called &lsquo;Michel&rsquo;
from France, who refers positively to a different company:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sunex&rsquo;s virtual office allows me to service these clients
from anywhere in the world, while maintaining a presence in
Texas.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So it seems that this review was copied from another website and
the company&rsquo;s name was not changed. The &ldquo;career&rdquo;
page offers an application form to apply for the &ldquo;local
agent&rdquo; position. The salary is stated in USD and is paid on a
weekly basis, which is also a very uncommon practice in
Austria.</p>
<!-- % NEWPAGE: -->

<h2 id="crosslinks">Crosslinks</h2>

<p>You can check how many other websites link to your targeted
website. In search engines like Google or Waybackmachine, type
&ldquo;link: www.start-office.biz&rdquo; or use online search tools
like backlinkwatch to figure out how many websites link to your
website in question. Both tools report no backlinks. It is not a
criminal act to have no websites linking to your website, but it
still looks suspicious, when a page claims to be a global player
and no customers link to them.</p>

<h2 id="contact-information">Contact Information</h2>

<p>Every page has to provide a possibility to contact the website
owner. Is the contact email the same as the domain name, or is it a
free-to-use webmail service. Is the postal address a valid address?
This can easily be checked through online streetmap services. Also
phone numbers can be checked to see whether the area code belongs
to a local number or if it is part of a call forwarding program.
What happens when you call the number? Is the line in use during
office hours?</p>

<p>In our example the company&rsquo;s address is the Twin Towers in
Vienna, although it doesn&rsquo;t provide a floor number. The phone
number has the correct country code &ldquo;+43&rdquo; for Austria
and &ldquo;1&rdquo; as a city code for Vienna. A quick search in
the local online telephone database ensures that the telephone
number is registered at the state telecommunication company A1, but
there is no name entry to be found.</p>

<p>There are two email addresses on the website:
support@start-office.biz and hr@start-office.biz. An alter ego
personality contacted both addresses and claimed to be looking for
a job in Vienna. A person called Thomas Anderson replied as a
representative of the company, sent me his Skype account details
and three pdfs that I should read through, fill out and return in
time. The three documents included an application for employment, a
confidentiality agreement and a job offer signed by a Michael
Adams, Director of Start-Office.biz. By using an IP tracker it is
possible to analyze the email header and obtain the IP address from
where the email was sent. In case of the email from Michael Adams,
the email provider is Telmex Colombia S.a. in Barranquilla,
Colombia.</p>

<h2 id="imprint">Imprint</h2>

<p>Depending on the country in which the company operates, a trade
registry number, VAT number, company address, and other legal
metadata and terms of use have to be published as a &ldquo;Site
notice&rdquo;, &ldquo;Legal notice&rdquo; or &ldquo;Legal
disclosure&rdquo;. This information can be double-checked on pages
like VIES/VAT number validation from the EU Commission<sup><a href="#6395fe56">82</a></sup> or the BBB &ndash; Better Business
Bureau<sup><a href="#a47576cf">83</a></sup>. According to
E-Commerce law, Austrian commercial companies have to have a legal
notice on their webpage. In the contact section of our example
website, there is no legal notice or VAT number published.</p>

<h2 id="domain-whois">Domain Whois</h2>

<p>WHOIS<sup><a href="#2cdd91f8">84</a></sup> stands for &ldquo;Who
is?&rdquo; and is a web-utility used to look up information on
domain names, contact information as well as some technical
information such as the domain&rsquo;s name servers (DNS). Every
domain owner has to provide valid contact information. This is part
of the registration agreement and providing false information can
result in your domain name being deleted, although some types of
domains do allow you to have placeholder information from another
company as the domain owner. By doing a whois look up on a targeted
domain, you can see when a domain was registered, last updated, and
how long this registration is valid. Often, scammers use the
minimum period of one year to register their domain, since they are
sure they will only be operating for a few months, and then they
open another domain. Further important information one can gather
is the hosting provider&rsquo;s name and contact information. This
to contact the hosting provider and report the fraudulent website.
It is also possible to track down inconsistencies, e.g. different
addresses or website owner from what is stated on the website.</p>

<p>In our example the registrant contact is a Mr. Fred Bohnsack,
living at 2775 Holdom Avenue in Surrey, B.C., Canada. The website
is hosted with hostgator.com and is registered for one year.</p>

<h2 id="reverse-ip-lookup">Reverse IP lookup</h2>

<p>Using a reverse IP Address lookup tool<sup><a href="#99f308fd">85</a></sup> it is possible to gain more insight into
all the different websites and domains hosted on that IP-address.
Often scammers run several websites at once, and it is just easier,
cheaper and more convenient to host them under the same provider.
This way, it is often possible to observe the working methods of a
group of scammers who operate several websites at once.</p>

<h2 id="html-code-and-text-analyzer">HTML code and text
analyzer</h2>

<p>Scammers often reuse their website templates. Once their
websites are taken off the Internet, they make small changes, e.g.
the business name, address, the logo or in the written text, and
register a different domain and upload the site again. To be able
to more quickly track down the website once it re-surfaces again,
anti-scam activists use online services like &lsquo;Talkwater
alerts&rsquo; and &lsquo;Google alerts&rsquo;. With these services
one can search for certain keywords or phrases and get instant
alert messages when the website is indexed. Activists specialize in
certain businesses and build up alert clusters.</p>

<p>Another toolset that can be used to track copied content on the
web are online plagiarism detection services like
&ldquo;citeliner&rdquo; or &ldquo;copyscape&rdquo;. Once you
copy/paste phrases of the website&rsquo;s text into the searchbox,
the services use the Google API to return websites that use the
same or similar text. This way it is possible to detect websites
that are clones of other websites, and with our example website we
found three other fake websites and also the &ldquo;real&rdquo;
source company, from which the content for the other websites was
copied.</p>

<p>In addition to analyzing the text on the website, when we look
into the HMTL code we find a reference that the website was
&ldquo;mirrored from sunexsolutions.com/ by HTTrack Website
Copier/3.x [XR&amp;CO\blank'2013], Sat, 11 Oct 2014 06:46:46
GMT&rdquo;. This reveals that the website
&ldquo;start-office.biz&rdquo; is a clone from
&ldquo;sunexsolutions.com&rdquo;. The sunexsolutions was amongst
the <em>Megacorp</em>. business websites that were scraped and
analyzed.</p>

<h2 id="the-megacorp.-business-conglomerate">The Megacorp. Business
Conglomerate</h2>

<p>The research of the scambaiting community &ldquo;Artists against
419&rdquo; led to a deeper investigation into how this community
tracks fake business websites and reports them. We wanted to
visualize the database, so our idea was to look at all these fake
companies as though they were one big evil corporate conglomerate
that wants to take over the world. This so called
<em>Megacorp</em>. is inspired by its equally powerful counterparts
in science fiction. The term was coined by William Gibson and
inspired many other authors of the dystopian cyberpunk science
fiction genre to create megacorps in their fiction, amongst others
the Tyrell corp. (<em>Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep</em>),
Encom corp. (<em>Tron</em>), Weyland-Yutani (<em>Alien
series</em>), Cyberdyne Skynet Systems (<em>Terminator</em>).</p>

<p>The artwork is based on a collection of 1000 fake websites
scraped from Internet. The creation of the <em>Megacorp</em>.
serves as an umbrella company that depicts the overall business
segments and countries where these fake businesses are present. An
interim report was published for the exhibition, and visitors have
an opportunity to browse locally through the network of fake
websites. Additionally a corporate presentation video and a
location reconnaissance video reflect both the imaginary and the
real world outreach of the <em>Megacorp</em>.</p>

<p>The data gathering process took several months. From September
2014 to April 2015. The aa419-database was visited on a daily basis
and websites were automatically downloaded using a site scraper
tool. The scraped websites were analyzed and categorized according
to business segment, street address, most prominently used color on
the webpage, registered city and country.</p>

<p>The findings are best described in the report, yet following
some key figures and reflections extracted from the CEO&rsquo;s
Letter<br>
(<em>Megacorp</em>. Interim report: First 1000 companies):</p>
<!-- % TEXINJECT: \scalefont{.96} -->

<blockquote>
<p>... We have divided our enterprise into 10 business segments, of
which the biggest are &lsquo;Transport and Logistics&rsquo;
(32.6%), &lsquo;Banking and Finance&rsquo; (21.9%) and
&lsquo;Online Merchandise and Trade&rsquo; (14.2%). It may come as
a surprise that the &lsquo;Pet Shops and Animal Transport&rsquo;
(6.9%) segment has a good chance of being the fourth largest
business segment. ... As mentioned, our company language is
currently restricted to English, and this might limit our presence
on some continents, especially Asia&rsquo;s lucrative market, while
apparently the Chinese phishers are responsible for 85% of the
domain names that were registered for phishing.</p>

of erasure, a symbolic attempt to escape datafication. The starting
point of the project is a public installation that offers USB keys
and a set of instructions in a pre-addressed envelope. The audience
that engages with the piece sends their data in the post to the
artist. In a biochemistry lab a digital data funeral is then
performed. The keys are immersed in a mix of acids called Aqua
Regia, used to dissolve noble metals. After digestion, the remains
are are sent back to the owner by post in a small jewelry box.</li>
