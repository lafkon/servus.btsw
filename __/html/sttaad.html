Technology-based Art and Destruction -- Exhibiting
Malfunctions</h1>

<div class="by">by Stefan Tiefengraber</div>

<p>Easy, uncomplicated interaction with interactive art
installations and an entertaining approach to attract visitors
opens up room to learn the story behind the art. These are the main
goals of my projects and a big part of the two introduced works
<em>User Generated Server Destruction</em><sup><a href="#801d67b8">1</a></sup> and <em>your unerasable
text</em><sup><a href="#02f1b640">2</a></sup>. Both works invite
visitors to destroy something. One time a text message is printed
out and shredded, and the other time it is the destruction of a
server by the force of hammers. The two installations are available
for 24 hours each and can also be operated by users not in the
venue, creating an independence of opening hours. While <em>your
unerasable text</em> is displayed in a shop window (depending on
the exhibition venue), <em>User Generated Server Destruction</em>
can be followed via a webcam, which is part of the installation.
The server is filmed and viewable via stream on a website
specifically created for that purpose.</p>

<p>Both installations are easy to interact with. <em>your
unerasable text</em> is operated by short messages and <em>User
Generated Server Destruction</em> provides three buttons on the
website to push. Behind this surface of fun and interactivity, the
user is invited to question the background of these technologies.
Why do the pieces work this way? What data is generated? Who has
access to it? Where is the data?</p>

<h2 id="user-generated-server-destruction----2013">User Generated
Server Destruction -- 2013</h2>

<p>Visitors of the website www.ugsd.net can trigger six hammers and
drop them onto a server that is located in the exhibition. This
server hosts the website, a single site that shows three buttons to
release the hammers and a video stream to follow what&rsquo;s
happening with the piece. The installation ends, once the server is
destroyed and can therefore no longer host the website.</p>

<p>If you are connected and looking at a website like this, it
seems to appear out of nothing. But there is data -- zeros and ones
compiling an image, text or a video. It is tempting to think there
is no physical connection to any hardware. The physical, sculptural
attendance of the work <em>User Generated Server Destruction</em>
typifies the coincidence of the virtual, the intangible world of
data, and the physical world, where we, the humans, exist. The
installation visualizes very directly that behind the virtuality
that we attribute to the data on the Internet, there actually is
tangible reality and actual physical hardware.</p>

<p>The Internet is a continually growing network of servers spread
all over the world. On the one side are the users and on the other
side the suppliers of the network. Usually, it is only possible for
computer viruses and very qualified users to attack and destroy
highly protected servers that are locked in well secured
places.</p>

<p>These places are data centers, where the big 'Data-Farmers' are
saving all the information we are providing them with. Looking like
factories, these centers have big tube systems to cool all the
computers. They are strategically built near rivers, guaranteeing
enough water for this process. You will always find a power plant
close to it, feeding electricity to computers, which are not only
hungry for data but also for electrical power. Highest standards of
security protect the data from loss by any means. The risk of
losing the data is not to be taken, no matter how important the
data is. One never knows for what or whom it might be useful for
some day.</p>

<p>As users we can control our computers and are able to easily
destroy hard drives. But the data we feed to clouds and websites is
impossible for us to control and erase. Spread over many hard
drives and servers across the world, there is no access for us.
<em>User Generated Server Destruction</em> poses a counterpart to
this. It is something that works in the other direction and hands
the power back to the users, who are all of a sudden in a position
to decide freely what happens to the data. It becomes possible to
erase one of the servers and thereby shrink the worldwide network
for the blink of an eye. What is left is a sculpture created by
destruction, typifying the physical presence of the Internet.</p>

<p>So far, 27 servers in several exhibitions all over the world
have been destroyed. Although employing similar hardware every
time, it took from 2 to 1002 hits for the hammers to finish the
destruction. Some servers stopped working after a short period of
operating and some worked for several days, although being hit
permanently. For some curators this is hard to exhibit, since the
installation can be destroyed at any time, leaving a
non-functioning artwork behind. That creates a fear of disappointed
visitors, not able to participate in the process of destruction.
Given the common notion that an interactive artwork has to function
non-stop, this is difficult.</p>

<p>The concept is to destroy the server and only leave a sculpture
and a video documentation behind, archiving the process. The server
is not supposed to be fake, and there is no intention to make it
more robust than it initially is. This would make the artwork
weaker. Each server receives an individual, ascending number, and
the hits are displayed on the website for every server in one
exhibition. Nevertheless, replacing the server after destruction
makes the piece more interesting for galleries and museums. A
solution for longer exhibitions, like the one in the Ars
Electronica Center in 2013, which lasted around three months, is to
only operate the server during a certain time of a day. The server
will be active 24 hours, but the time of operation is limited.</p>

<p>At the Node festival in 2015, the curators agreed to just show
one server and host a &ldquo;launch event&rdquo; following an
artist talk. This provides the time to generate curiosity and
create attention, as everyone wants to have the first, and maybe
already final, hit on the server. A lot of people waited to finally
hear the sound of the 800 grams heavy sledgehammers smashing the
metal cover of the computer.</p>

<h2 id="your-unerasable-text----201112">your unerasable text --
2011/12</h2>

<p><em>your unerasable text</em> is an interactive installation
dealing with the topics of data storage and elimination. The
installation can be placed in an exhibition, but is ideally
exhibited in a window in public space, where it can be used by
people passing by 24h a day.</p>

<p>The participant is asked to send a text message to the number
written on a sign next to the installation: &ldquo;send your
unerasable text message to +43 664 1788374&rdquo;</p>

<p>The receiving mobile phone transfers the data to a computer,
which layouts the message automatically. It is then printed on to a
DIN A6 paper, falling directly into a paper shredder. There, the
message remains readable for a few moments and is then destroyed.
The shredded paper forms a visible heap of paper on the floor,
growing with every message.</p>

<p><em>your unerasable text</em> works via SMS, as it is the
easiest and most comfortable way for the participant -- and almost
everybody owns a mobile phone. The standard for the short message
service was implemented in the early 1990s and is still used and
integrated in every mobile phone, even in smart phones. Another
advantage is that users don&rsquo;t have to be close to the
installation, messages can be sent from all over the world, and
they don&rsquo;t need any additional software or access to the
Internet to participate.</p>

<p>When <em>your unerasable text</em> is used, the sent text
message isn&rsquo;t erased. The data is passing by the mobile
carrier of the sender and receiver, the mobile that is integrated
in the installation and the computer processing the text and
sending it to the printer. At each of these points the data can be
saved. The installation stores a file of each message consisting of
the sent text, the phone number of the sender, and time and date
when it was sent. The only thing that actually is erased, is the
print, which is just a visualization having no effect on the data
itself.</p>

<p>The storing of data is a rather current topic, given the
discussions on bringing back the
&ldquo;Vorratsdatenspeicherung&rdquo; (data preservation) in
Germany, along with discussions in the Austrian parliament about
passing the &ldquo;Staatsschutzgesetz&rdquo; (state protection law)
including points to bring back the previously overturned
&ldquo;Vorratsdatenspeicherung&rdquo;, under the guise of this new
law.</p>
<!-- % HYPHENATE: Vorratsdatenspeicherung Vorrats-datenspeicherung -->
<!-- % H!YPHENATE: Vorratsdatenspeicherung Vor-rats-daten-spei-che-rung -->

<p>Also very recently, the Safe Harbor law was declared illegal by
the Court of Justice of the European Union, creating the need for
re-negotiation between the EU and the US to change this law.</p>

<p>This also raises questions about the locations of the servers we
are using and the law applied to the data stored on hard-drives all
over the world. There has to be a definition of who legally has
access to our data and is able to pass our information on to third
parties. This is also a significant topic in the installation
<em>User Generated Server Destruction</em>.</p>

<p>As far as exhibitions and other possibilities for exhibiting
these works are concerned, maintenance is a crucial point. Both
installations have a high frequency of usage, 27 servers have
already been shown and destroyed in 10 exhibitions. By November
2015 more then 27.400 short messages were collected.</p>
