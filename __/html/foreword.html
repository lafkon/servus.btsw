<h1 id="amro-research-lab-2015">AMRO Research Lab 2015</h1>

<p>This publication documents the first research lab<sup><a href="#99ddfbf6">1</a></sup> in conjunction with the Austrian net
culture initiative servus.at based in Linz. The idea for this kind
of lab, which is able to explore a specific topic and the
associated challenges for the information age in depth over the
course of one year, is rooted in the festival &ldquo;Art Meets
Radical Openness&rdquo;<sup><a href="#20d32f03">2</a></sup>, which
takes place biennially since 2008 in cooperation with the Art
University Linz. This is a community festival originating in the
Free Software movement and the early Austrian initiative
Linuxwochen (Linux Weeks<sup><a href="#81584145">3</a></sup>), but
this event has been expanded with cultural, artistic, and
social-critical aspects in connection with technology. When art
meets radical openness, this suggests a paradox.</p>

<p>For what is generally considered contemporary art is rarely
&ldquo;radically open&rdquo; in the sense that its authors
purposely make sources, processes and contents accessible for
further processing, as is the rule with F/LOSS (free/libre Open
Source Software) projects. What may succeed in the development of
free software, however, poses a challenge to us in the way we deal
with information. Which information is meaningful and should be
made accessible to whom in which form?</p>
<!-- % CLEARTORIGHT: -->

<p>The festival brings together a diverse group of actors (artists,
cultural workers, philosophers, software developers, hacktivists,
activists, and journalists), who often operate in different fields
at the same time (art, education, journalism, activism, software
development and more) and principally agree on the value of using
alternative tools, based on a social-critical stance. This
fundamental stance influences not only how we deal with technology
per se, but also the approach to issues concerning the complex
conditions of our digital infosphere, which impels an unremitting
cultural transformation that has a real impact on our life and the
way we deal with our world today.</p>

<p>For us, the collaboration with the artist collective KairUs -
Linda Kronman &amp; Andreas Zingerle has proved to be very
valuable. Their research topic &ldquo;Behind the Smart World&rdquo;
with its original starting point of twenty-two harddisks from the
largest recycling center in Ghana has led us to a collection of
theoretical and artistic positions focusing on a fundamental
problem of our times, the saving, deleting and resurfacing of
information.</p>
