Strategies of Net-activists Against Phishing and Fake Business
Websites</h1>

<div class="by">by KairUs - Linda Kronman and Andreas
Zingerle</div>

<p>This essay is part of our artistic research into vigilante
online communities and Internet fraud. Online communities of so
called scambaiters try to identify, block and report Internet crime
activities. For this they have developed various strategies,
ranging from creating warning platforms to collecting fake checks
or blocking bank accounts, and they organize themselves in
different forums.<sup><a href="#237622f9">1</a></sup> One of these
subgroups call themselves &ldquo;Artists against 419&rdquo; and
host the biggest open-access database of fake websites. As of
November 2015, there are over 4800 registered users and on average
about 35 websites are added to the database each day. They use
&ldquo;passive reconnaissance&rdquo; and &ldquo;open source
intelligence&rdquo; (osint) tools to gather information, so that
they can file reports to the hosting provider to get the websites
taken off the web. Since 2007, the group members have discontinued
using web programs such as &ldquo;Lad Vampire&rdquo; or
&ldquo;Muguito&rdquo; to run &ldquo;Denial of Service&rdquo;
attacks against the websites<sup><a href="#410e2b7a">2</a></sup>
and instead use online tools and written reports to maintain good
relations with hosting providers and law enforcement<sup><a href="#5e945767">3</a></sup>. In the following paragraphs we want to
present one of their work-flow strategies to track and report fake
websites.</p>

<p>Scambaiters use various vernacular tools and social engineering
techniques in order to run background checks on suspicious business
websites. Open source intelligence (osint) refers to intelligence
that has been derived from publicly available sources both on- and
offline. These tools are used in &ldquo;ethical passive
reconnaissance<sup><a href="#12203ae0">4</a></sup>&rdquo; to gather
as much information about the target as possible. In this version,
passive reconnaissance is perpetrated by activists and hacktivists
who are trying to gain information that will support their
political causes or other such ethical motivations. Law enforcement
officials may also use passive reconnaissance as part of a criminal
investigation. Ethical or not, passive reconnaissance is always
done without the authorization of the person or organization that
is being targeted.<sup><a href="#36a8dbcf">5</a></sup></p>

<p>This leads to an effective combination of classical social
engineering attacks on the target, which in turn can be used to
harvest more information. The following chapter summarizes the
hands-on part of a workshop called &ldquo;Credible fictions &ndash;
Deceptive realities&rdquo;<sup><a href="#b09475f2">6</a></sup>. In
the workshop the <em>Megacorp.</em> installation served as a point
of departure to further investigate Internet activism, resurfacing
fake websites and osint tools. The online tools were presented to
the group of participants, who gathered and discussed information
using the collaborative writing tool &ldquo;piratepad&rdquo;.</p>

<p>As an example website we want to focus on www.start-office.biz.
According to their website, start-office.biz is an international
company specializing in organizing virtual offices. They are
located at the Wienerberg Twin Towers in Vienna, Austria, and
currently offer jobs to local agents who should &ldquo;provide
relevant information online for direct clients and other relevant
stakeholders through through popular social networking
sites&rdquo;. In the following paragraphs, we will use the osint
tools to analyze the website and raise suspicion about the
legitimacy of the website.</p>

<h2 id="look-and-feel">Look and Feel</h2>

<p>Every website is designed differently. Over the years certain
trends in usability set standards for web designers. You can always
ask yourself, how coherent is the web design? Does a photo with the
company logo have a pixelated, poor quality, whereas all other
photos are crisp and sharp? Does the logo look badly manipulated
into an image?</p>

<p>On the front page of our example website we see the dark black
logo of start-office.biz. Font type and size of the logo look
misplaced and don&rsquo;t fit the overall dominant gray and dark
blue color combination. In one of the header images the logo is
clearly squeezed in the image. The company&rsquo;s headquarter is
supposedly located in Vienna, Austria. The website claims to
operate on a global scale and runs hundreds of offices in the USA
and Canada. The page language is English and there is no
translation to German available. On the &ldquo;testimonials&rdquo;
page we find a review from a person called &lsquo;Michel&rsquo;
from France, who refers positively to a different company:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sunex&rsquo;s virtual office allows me to service these clients
from anywhere in the world, while maintaining a presence in
Texas.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So it seems that this review was copied from another website and
the company&rsquo;s name was not changed. The &ldquo;career&rdquo;
page offers an application form to apply for the &ldquo;local
agent&rdquo; position. The salary is stated in USD and is paid on a
weekly basis, which is also a very uncommon practice in
Austria.</p>
<!-- % NEWPAGE: -->

<h2 id="crosslinks">Crosslinks</h2>

<p>You can check how many other websites link to your targeted
website. In search engines like Google or Waybackmachine, type
&ldquo;link: www.start-office.biz&rdquo; or use online search tools
like backlinkwatch to figure out how many websites link to your
website in question. Both tools report no backlinks. It is not a
criminal act to have no websites linking to your website, but it
still looks suspicious, when a page claims to be a global player
and no customers link to them.</p>

<h2 id="contact-information">Contact Information</h2>

<p>Every page has to provide a possibility to contact the website
owner. Is the contact email the same as the domain name, or is it a
free-to-use webmail service. Is the postal address a valid address?
This can easily be checked through online streetmap services. Also
phone numbers can be checked to see whether the area code belongs
to a local number or if it is part of a call forwarding program.
What happens when you call the number? Is the line in use during
office hours?</p>

<p>In our example the company&rsquo;s address is the Twin Towers in
Vienna, although it doesn&rsquo;t provide a floor number. The phone
number has the correct country code &ldquo;+43&rdquo; for Austria
and &ldquo;1&rdquo; as a city code for Vienna. A quick search in
the local online telephone database ensures that the telephone
number is registered at the state telecommunication company A1, but
there is no name entry to be found.</p>

<p>There are two email addresses on the website:
support@start-office.biz and hr@start-office.biz. An alter ego
personality contacted both addresses and claimed to be looking for
a job in Vienna. A person called Thomas Anderson replied as a
representative of the company, sent me his Skype account details
and three pdfs that I should read through, fill out and return in
time. The three documents included an application for employment, a
confidentiality agreement and a job offer signed by a Michael
Adams, Director of Start-Office.biz. By using an IP tracker it is
possible to analyze the email header and obtain the IP address from
where the email was sent. In case of the email from Michael Adams,
the email provider is Telmex Colombia S.a. in Barranquilla,
Colombia.</p>

<h2 id="imprint">Imprint</h2>

<p>Depending on the country in which the company operates, a trade
registry number, VAT number, company address, and other legal
metadata and terms of use have to be published as a &ldquo;Site
notice&rdquo;, &ldquo;Legal notice&rdquo; or &ldquo;Legal
disclosure&rdquo;. This information can be double-checked on pages
like VIES/VAT number validation from the EU Commission<sup><a href="#6395fe56">7</a></sup> or the BBB &ndash; Better Business
Bureau<sup><a href="#a47576cf">8</a></sup>. According to E-Commerce
law, Austrian commercial companies have to have a legal notice on
their webpage. In the contact section of our example website, there
is no legal notice or VAT number published.</p>

<h2 id="domain-whois">Domain Whois</h2>

<p>WHOIS<sup><a href="#2cdd91f8">9</a></sup> stands for &ldquo;Who
is?&rdquo; and is a web-utility used to look up information on
domain names, contact information as well as some technical
information such as the domain&rsquo;s name servers (DNS). Every
domain owner has to provide valid contact information. This is part
of the registration agreement and providing false information can
result in your domain name being deleted, although some types of
domains do allow you to have placeholder information from another
company as the domain owner. By doing a whois look up on a targeted
domain, you can see when a domain was registered, last updated, and
how long this registration is valid. Often, scammers use the
minimum period of one year to register their domain, since they are
sure they will only be operating for a few months, and then they
open another domain. Further important information one can gather
is the hosting provider&rsquo;s name and contact information. This
to contact the hosting provider and report the fraudulent website.
It is also possible to track down inconsistencies, e.g. different
addresses or website owner from what is stated on the website.</p>

<p>In our example the registrant contact is a Mr. Fred Bohnsack,
living at 2775 Holdom Avenue in Surrey, B.C., Canada. The website
is hosted with hostgator.com and is registered for one year.</p>

<h2 id="reverse-ip-lookup">Reverse IP lookup</h2>

<p>Using a reverse IP Address lookup tool<sup><a href="#99f308fd">10</a></sup> it is possible to gain more insight into
all the different websites and domains hosted on that IP-address.
Often scammers run several websites at once, and it is just easier,
cheaper and more convenient to host them under the same provider.
This way, it is often possible to observe the working methods of a
group of scammers who operate several websites at once.</p>

<h2 id="html-code-and-text-analyzer">HTML code and text
analyzer</h2>

<p>Scammers often reuse their website templates. Once their
websites are taken off the Internet, they make small changes, e.g.
the business name, address, the logo or in the written text, and
register a different domain and upload the site again. To be able
to more quickly track down the website once it re-surfaces again,
anti-scam activists use online services like &lsquo;Talkwater
alerts&rsquo; and &lsquo;Google alerts&rsquo;. With these services
one can search for certain keywords or phrases and get instant
alert messages when the website is indexed. Activists specialize in
certain businesses and build up alert clusters.</p>

<p>Another toolset that can be used to track copied content on the
web are online plagiarism detection services like
&ldquo;citeliner&rdquo; or &ldquo;copyscape&rdquo;. Once you
copy/paste phrases of the website&rsquo;s text into the searchbox,
the services use the Google API to return websites that use the
same or similar text. This way it is possible to detect websites
that are clones of other websites, and with our example website we
found three other fake websites and also the &ldquo;real&rdquo;
source company, from which the content for the other websites was
copied.</p>

<p>In addition to analyzing the text on the website, when we look
into the HMTL code we find a reference that the website was
&ldquo;mirrored from sunexsolutions.com/ by HTTrack Website
Copier/3.x [XR&amp;CO\blank'2013], Sat, 11 Oct 2014 06:46:46
GMT&rdquo;. This reveals that the website
&ldquo;start-office.biz&rdquo; is a clone from
&ldquo;sunexsolutions.com&rdquo;. The sunexsolutions was amongst
the <em>Megacorp</em>. business websites that were scraped and
analyzed.</p>

<h2 id="the-megacorp.-business-conglomerate">The Megacorp. Business
Conglomerate</h2>

<p>The research of the scambaiting community &ldquo;Artists against
419&rdquo; led to a deeper investigation into how this community
tracks fake business websites and reports them. We wanted to
visualize the database, so our idea was to look at all these fake
companies as though they were one big evil corporate conglomerate
that wants to take over the world. This so called
<em>Megacorp</em>. is inspired by its equally powerful counterparts
in science fiction. The term was coined by William Gibson and
inspired many other authors of the dystopian cyberpunk science
fiction genre to create megacorps in their fiction, amongst others
the Tyrell corp. (<em>Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep</em>),
Encom corp. (<em>Tron</em>), Weyland-Yutani (<em>Alien
series</em>), Cyberdyne Skynet Systems (<em>Terminator</em>).</p>

<p>The artwork is based on a collection of 1000 fake websites
scraped from Internet. The creation of the <em>Megacorp</em>.
serves as an umbrella company that depicts the overall business
segments and countries where these fake businesses are present. An
interim report was published for the exhibition, and visitors have
an opportunity to browse locally through the network of fake
websites. Additionally a corporate presentation video and a
location reconnaissance video reflect both the imaginary and the
real world outreach of the <em>Megacorp</em>.</p>

<p>The data gathering process took several months. From September
2014 to April 2015. The aa419-database was visited on a daily basis
and websites were automatically downloaded using a site scraper
tool. The scraped websites were analyzed and categorized according
to business segment, street address, most prominently used color on
the webpage, registered city and country.</p>

<p>The findings are best described in the report, yet following
some key figures and reflections extracted from the CEO&rsquo;s
Letter<br>
(<em>Megacorp</em>. Interim report: First 1000 companies):</p>
<!-- % TEXINJECT: \scalefont{.96} -->

<blockquote>
<p>... We have divided our enterprise into 10 business segments, of
which the biggest are &lsquo;Transport and Logistics&rsquo;
(32.6%), &lsquo;Banking and Finance&rsquo; (21.9%) and
&lsquo;Online Merchandise and Trade&rsquo; (14.2%). It may come as
a surprise that the &lsquo;Pet Shops and Animal Transport&rsquo;
(6.9%) segment has a good chance of being the fourth largest
business segment. ... As mentioned, our company language is
currently restricted to English, and this might limit our presence
on some continents, especially Asia&rsquo;s lucrative market, while
apparently the Chinese phishers are responsible for 85% of the
domain names that were registered for phishing.</p>

computer and computer mediated human-human interaction with a
special interest in transmedia and interactive storytelling. Since
2010 we have worked with the theme of Internet fraud and online
scams, constantly shifting our focus and therefore approaching the
theme from a number of perspectives, such as data security, data
privacy, ethics of vigilante communities, narratives of scam
e-mails, and technologies in relation to fraud.</p>
